   TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE JAMES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD,


   KING OF GREAT BRITIAN, FRANCE, AND IRELAND,


   DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, ETC.


   THE TRANSLATORS OF THE BIBLE WISH GRACE, MERCY, AND PEACE,


   THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR Lord


   Great and manifold were the blessings, most dread Sovereign, which
   Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, bestowed upon us the people of
   England, when first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and
   reign over us. For whereas it was the expectation of many, who wished
   not well unto our Sion, that, upon the setting of that bright
   Occindental Star, Queen Elizabeth, of most happy memory, some thick and
   palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land, that
   men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk, and that it
   should hardly be known who was to direct the unsettled State; the
   appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in his strength, instantly
   dispelled those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all that
   were well affected exceeding cause of comfort; especially when we
   beheld the Government established in Your Highness, and Your hopeful
   Seed, by an undoubted Title; and this also accompanied with peace and
   tranquillity at home and abroad.

   But among all of our joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts
   than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God's sacred Word
   among us, which is that inestimable treasure which excelleth all the
   riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself, not
   only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and
   disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.

   Then not to suffer this fall to the ground, but rather to take it up,
   and to continue it in that state wherein the famous Predecessor of Your
   Highness did leave it; nay, to go forward with the confidence and
   resolution of a man, in maintaining the truth of Christ, and
   propagating it far and near is that which hath so bound and firmly knit
   the hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people unto You,
   that Your very name is precious among them: their eye doth behold You
   with comfort, and they bless You in their hearts, as that sanctified
   Person, who, under God, is the immediate author of their true
   happiness. And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay, but
   every day increaseth and taketh strength, when they observe that the
   zeal of Your Majesty toward the house of God doth not slack or go
   backward, but is more and more kindled, manifesting itself abroad in
   the farthest parts of Christendom, by writing in defence of the truth,
   (which hath given such a blow unto that Man of Sin as will not be
   healed,) and every day at home, by religious and learned discourse, by
   frequenting the house of God, by hearing the Word preached, by
   cherishing the teachers thereof, by caring for the Church, as a most
   tender and loving nursing father.

   There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and religious
   affection in Your Majesty; but none is more forcible to declare it to
   others than the vehement and perpetuated desire of accomplishing and
   publishing of this work, which now, with all humility, we present unto
   Your Majesty. For when Your Highness had once, out of deep judgement,
   apprehended how convenient it was, that, out of the Original sacred
   Tongues, together with comparing of the labours, both in our own and
   other foreign languages, of many worthy men who went before us, there
   should be one more exact translation of the Holy Scriptures into the
   English tongue; Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite
   those to whom it was commended, that the Work might be hastened, and
   that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner, as a matter
   of such importance might justly require.

   And now at last, by the mercy of God, and the continuance of our
   labours, it being brought unto such a conclusion, as that we have great
   hopes that the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby, we hold
   it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty, not only as to our King and
   Sovereign, but as to the principal mover and author of the Work; humbly
   craving of your most Sacred Majesty, that, since things of this quality
   have ever been subject to the censures of ill-meaning and discontented
   persons, it may receive approbation and patronage from so learned and
   judicious a Prince as Your Highness is; whose allowance and acceptance
   of our labours shall more honour and encourage us, than all the
   calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us. So
   that if, on the one side, we shall be traduced by Popish persons at
   home or abroad, who therefore will malign us, because we are poor
   instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known unto
   the people, whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness;
   or if, on the other side, we shall be maligned by self-conceited
   brethren, who run their own ways, and give liking unto nothing but what
   is framed by themselves, and hammered on their anvil, we may rest
   secure, supported within by the truth and innocency of a good
   conscience, having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity, as
   before the Lord, and sustained without by the powerful protection of
   Your Majesty's grace and favour, which will ever give countenance to
   honest and Christian endeavours against bitter censures and
   uncharitable imputations.

   The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy
   days, that, as his heavenly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many
   singular and extraordinary graces, so You may be the wonder of the
   world in this latter age for happiness and true felicity, to the honour
   of that great God, and the good of his Church, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord and only Saviour.

THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER

  Preface to the King James Version of 1611

  THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED

   Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything
   ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured by others,
   deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold
   entertainment in the world. It is welcomed with suspicion instead of
   love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole
   left for cavil to enter, (and cavil, if it do not find a hole, will
   make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.
   This will easily be granted by as many as know story, or have any
   experience. For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of
   newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying,
   or opposition? A man would think that Civility, wholesome Laws,
   learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak
   of no more things of this kind) should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and
   out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor
   dog move his tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we
   are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the
   second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and
   from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by violence; By the third,
   we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling
   that we have attained unto ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being
   brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our
   differences than by writings which are endless; And lastly, that the
   Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and
   conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill
   their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing fathers and
   mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon
   their breasts (and upon whose breasts again themselves do hang to
   receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and
   support fit for their estates. Thus it is apparent, that these things
   which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none,
   either without absurdity can speak against them, or without note of
   wickedness can spurn against them.

   Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis
   with others] have been brought to untimely death for none other fault,
   but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline;
   and that in some Commonwealths [e.g. Locri] it was made a capital
   crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an
   old, though the same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the
   elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of
   Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way
   to good Letters and refined speech, but bare themselves as averse from
   them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no
   babe, but a great clerk [Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in
   writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he
   gave forth, that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or
   meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against
   Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and
   messengers of the great King of Kings should be furnished, it is not
   unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better
   by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], though superstitious) was devised;
   Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of
   Christianity in the Church of Rome, then a true Church, were liberally
   endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying: Now is poison
   poured down into the Church, etc. Thus not only as oft as we speak, as
   one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or consequence, we
   subject ourselves to everyone's censure, and happy is he that is least
   tossed upon tongues; for utterly to escape the snatch of them it is
   impossible. If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the
   meaner sort only, and that Princes are privileged by their high estate,
   he is deceived. "As the sword devoureth as well one as the other," as
   it is in Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great Commander charged his
   soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy, but at
   the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief Captains to
   "fight neither with small nor great, save only against the King of
   Israel:" [1 Kings 22:31] so it is too true, that Envy striketh most
   spitefully at the fairest, and at the chiefest. David was a worthy
   Prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deeds, and yet
   for as worthy as act as ever he did (even for bringing back the Ark of
   God in solemnity) he was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife [2 Sam
   6:16]. Solomon was greater than David, though not in virtue, yet in
   power: and by his power and wisdom he built a Temple to the Lord, such
   a one as was the glory of the land of Israel, and the wonder of the
   whole world. But was that his magnificence liked of by all? We doubt
   it. Otherwise, why do they lay it in his son's dish, and call unto him
   for easing the burden, "Make", say they, "the grievous servitude of thy
   father, and his sore yoke, lighter?" [1 Kings 12:4] Belike he had
   charged them with some levies, and troubled them with some carriages;
   Hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their heart the Temple
   had never been built. So hard a thing it is to please all, even when we
   please God best, and do seek to approve ourselves to every ones
   conscience.

   If we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples
   of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance. The first Roman Emperor [C.
   Caesar. Plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the learned, nor
   more profitable to posterity, for conserving the record of times in
   true supputation; than when he corrected the Calendar, and ordered the
   year according to the course of the Sun; and yet this was imputed to
   him for novelty, and arrogance, and procured to him great obloguy. So
   the first Christened Emperor [Constantine] (at the least-wise that
   openly professed the faith himself, and allowed others to do the like)
   for strengthening the Empire at his great charges, and providing for
   the Church, as he did, got for his labour the name Pupillus, as who
   would say, a wasteful Prince, that had need of a Guardian or overseer
   [Aurel. Victor]. So the best Christened Emperor [Theodosius], for the
   love that he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich both himself and his
   subjects, and because he did not see war but find it, was judged to be
   no man at arms [Zosimus], (though indeed he excelled in feats of
   chivalry, and showed so much when he was provoked) and condemned for
   giving himself to his ease, and to his pleasure. To be short, the most
   learned Emperor of former times [Justinian], (at the least, the
   greatest politician) what thanks had he for cutting off the
   superfluities of the laws, and digesting them into some order and
   method? This, that he had been blotted by some to be an Epitomist, that
   is, one that extinguishes worthy whole volumes, to bring his
   abridgments into request. This is the measure that hath been rendered
   to excellent Princes in former times, even, Cum bene facerent, male
   audire, For their good deeds to be evil spoken of. Neither is there any
   likelihood, that envy and malignity died, and were buried with the
   ancient. No, no, the reproof of Moses taketh hold of most ages; "You
   are risen up in your fathers' stead, and increase of sinful men." [Num
   32:14] "What is that that hath been done? that which shall be done; and
   there is no new thing under the Sun," saith the wiseman: [Ecc 1:9] and
   S. Stephen, "As your fathers did, so do you." [Acts 7:51]

    HIS MAJESTY'S CONSTANCY, NOTWITHSTANDING CULMINATION, FOR THE SURVEY OF THE
    ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS

   This, and more to this purpose, His Majesty that now reigneth (and
   long, and long may he reign, and his offspring forever, "Himself and
   children, and children's always) knew full well, according to the
   singular wisdom given unto him by God, and the rare learning and
   experience that he hath attained unto; namely that whosoever attempteth
   anything for the public (especially if it pertain to Religion, and to
   the opening and clearing of the word of God) the same setteth himself
   upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth
   himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue. For he
   that medleth with men's Religion in any part, medleth with their
   custom, nay, with their freehold; and though they find no content in
   that which they have, yet they cannot abide to hear of altering.
   Notwithstanding his Royal heart was not daunted or discouraged for this
   that colour, but stood resolute, "as a statue immovable, and an anvil
   not easy to be beaten into plates," as one [Suidas] saith; he knew who
   had chosen him to be a Soldier, or rather a Captain, and being assured
   that the course which he intended made for the glory of God, and the
   building up of his Church, he would not suffer it to be broken off for
   whatsoever speeches or practices. It doth certainly belong unto Kings,
   yea, it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea,
   it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, to
   know it aright, yea, to profess it zealously, yea to promote it to the
   uttermost of their power. This is their glory before all nations which
   mean well, and this will bring unto them a far most excellent weight of
   glory in the day of the Lord Jesus. For the Scripture saith not in
   vain, "Them that honor me, I will honor," [1 Sam 2:30] neither was it a
   vain word that Eusebius delivered long ago, that piety towards God was
   the weapon and the only weapon, that both preserved Constantine's
   person, and avenged him of his enemies [Eusebius lib 10 cap 8].

    THE PRAISE OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES

   But now what piety without truth? what truth (what saving truth)
   without the word of God? What word of God (whereof we may be sure)
   without the Scripture? The Scriptures we are commanded to search. John
   5:39. Isa 8:20. They are commended that searched and studied them. Acts
   17:11 and 8:28,29. They are reproved that were unskillful in them, or
   slow to believe them. Matt 22:29. Luke 24:25. They can make us wise
   unto salvation. 2 Tim 3:15. If we be ignorant, they will instruct us;
   if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of order, they will
   reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull, quicken us; if cold,
   inflame us. Tolle, lege; Tolle, lege, Take up and read, take up and
   read the Scriptures [S. August. confess. lib 8 cap 12], (for unto them
   was the direction) it was said unto S. Augustine by a supernatural
   voice. "Whatsoever is in the Scriptures, believe me," saith the same S.
   Augustine, "is high and divine; there is verily truth, and a doctrine
   most fit for the refreshing of men's minds, and truly so tempered, that
   everyone may draw from thence that which is sufficient for him, if he
   come to draw with a devout and pious mind, as true Religion requireth."
   [S. August. de utilitcredendi cap. 6] Thus S. Augustine. and S. Jerome:
   "Ama scripturas, et amabit te sapientia etc." [S. Jerome. ad Demetriad]
   Love the Scriptures, and wisdom will love thee. And S. Cyril against
   Julian; "Even boys that are bred up in the Scriptures, become most
   religious, etc. [S. Cyril. 7 contra Iulianum] But what mention we three
   or four uses of the Scripture, whereas whatsoever is to be believed or
   practiced, or hoped for, is contained in them? or three or four
   sentences of the Fathers, since whosoever is worthy the name of a
   Father, from Christ's time downward, hath likewise written not only of
   the riches, but also of the perfection of the Scripture? "I adore the
   fulness of the Scripture," saith Tertullian against Hermogenes.
   [Tertul. advers. Hermo.] And again, to Apelles an heretic of the like
   stamp, he saith; "I do not admit that which thou bringest in (or
   concludest) of thine own (head or store, de tuo) without Scripture."
   [Tertul. de carne Christi.] So Saint Justin Martyr before him; "We must
   know by all means," saith he, "that it is not lawful (or possible) to
   learn (anything) of God or of right piety, save only out of the
   Prophets, who teach us by divine inspiration." So Saint Basil after
   Tertullian, "It is a manifest falling way from the Faith, and a fault
   of presumption, either to reject any of those things that are written,
   or to bring in (upon the head of them) any of those things that are not
   written. We omit to cite to the same effect, S. Cyril B. of Jerusalem
   in his 4::Cataches., Saint Jerome against Helvidius, Saint Augustine in
   his 3::book against the letters of Petilian, and in very many other
   places of his works. Also we forebear to descend to later Fathers,
   because we will not weary the reader. The Scriptures then being
   acknowledged to be so full and so perfect, how can we excuse ourselves
   of negligence, if we do not study them, of curiosity, if we be not
   content with them? Men talk much of [an olive bow wrapped about with
   wood, whereupon did hang figs, and bread, honey in a pot, and oil], how
   many sweet and goodly things it had hanging on it; of the Philosopher's
   stone, that it turned copper into gold; of Cornucopia, that it had all
   things necessary for food in it, of Panaces the herb, that it was good
   for diseases, of Catholicon the drug, that it is instead of all purges;
   of Vulcan's armor, that it was an armor of proof against all thrusts,
   and all blows, etc. Well, that which they falsely or vainly attributed
   to these things for bodily god, we may justly and with full measure
   ascribe unto the Scripture, for spiritual. It is not only an armor, but
   also a whole armory of weapons, both offensive and defensive; whereby
   we may save ourselves and put the enemy to flight. It is not an herb,
   but a tree, or rather a whole paradise of trees of life, which bring
   forth fruit every month, and the fruit thereof is for meat, and the
   leaves for medicine. It is not a pot of Manna, or a cruse of oil, which
   were for memory only, or for a meal's meat or two, but as it were a
   shower of heavenly bread sufficient for a whole host, be it never so
   great; and as it were a whole cellar full of oil vessels; whereby all
   our necessities may be provided for, and our debts discharged. In a
   word, it is a Panary of wholesome food, against fenowed traditions; a
   Physician's shop (Saint Basil called it) [S. Basil in Psal. primum.] of
   preservatives against poisoned heresies; a Pandect of profitable laws,
   against rebellious spirits; a treasury of most costly jewels, against
   beggarly rudiments; finally a fountain of most pure water springing up
   unto everlasting life. And what marvel? The original thereof being from
   heaven, not from earth; the author being God, not man; the inditer, the
   holy spirit, not the wit of the Apostles or Prophets; the Penmen such
   as were sanctified from the womb, and endued with a principal portion
   of God's spirit; the matter, verity, piety, purity, uprightness; the
   form, God's word, God's testimony, God's oracles, the word of truth,
   the word of salvation, etc.; the effects, light of understanding,
   stableness of persuasion, repentance from dead works, newness of life,
   holiness, peace, joy in the holy Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of
   the study thereof, fellowship with the Saints, participation of the
   heavenly nature, fruition of an inheritance immortal, undefiled, and
   that never shall fade away: Happy is the man that delighted in the
   Scripture, and thrice happy that meditateth in it day and night.

    TRANSLATION NECESSARY

   But how shall men meditate in that, which they cannot understand? How
   shall they understand that which is kept close in an unknown tongue? as
   it is written, "Except I know the power of the voice, I shall be to him
   that speaketh, a Barbarian, and he that speaketh, shall be a Barbarian
   to me." [1 Cor 14] The Apostle excepteth no tongue; not Hebrew the
   ancientest, not Greek the most copious, not Latin the finest. Nature
   taught a natural man to confess, that all of us in those tongues which
   we do not understand, are plainly deaf; we may turn the deaf ear unto
   them. The Scythian counted the Athenian, whom he did not understand,
   barbarous; [Clem. Alex. 1 Strom.] so the Roman did the Syrian, and the
   Jew (even S. Jerome himself called the Hebrew tongue barbarous, belike
   because it was strange to so many) [S. Jerome. Damaso.] so the Emperor
   of Constantinople [Michael, Theophili fil.] calleth the Latin tongue,
   barbarous, though Pope Nicolas do storm at it: [2::Tom. Concil. ex
   edit. Petri Crab] so the Jews long before Christ called all other
   nations, Lognazim, which is little better than barbarous. Therefore as
   one complaineth, that always in the Senate of Rome, there was one or
   other that called for an interpreter: [Cicero 5::de finibus.] so lest
   the Church be driven to the like exigent, it is necessary to have
   translations in a readiness. Translation it is that openeth the window,
   to let in the light; that breaketh the shell, that we may eat the
   kernel; that putteth aside the curtain, that we may look into the most
   Holy place; that removeth the cover of the well, that we may come by
   the water, even as Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the
   well, by which means the flocks of Laban were watered [Gen 29:10].
   Indeed without translation into the vulgar tongue, the unlearned are
   but like children at Jacob's well (which is deep) [John 4:11] without a
   bucket or something to draw with; or as that person mentioned by
   Isaiah, to whom when a sealed book was delivered, with this motion,
   "Read this, I pray thee," he was fain to make this answer, "I cannot,
   for it is sealed." [Isa 29:11]

    THE TRANSLATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT OUT OF THE HEBREW INTO GREEK

   While God would be known only in Jacob, and have his Name great in
   Israel, and in none other place, while the dew lay on Gideon's fleece
   only, and all the earth besides was dry; then for one and the same
   people, which spake all of them the language of Canaan, that is,
   Hebrew, one and the same original in Hebrew was sufficient. [S. August.
   lib 12 contra Faust c32] But, when the fulness of time drew near, that
   the Sun of righteousness, the Son of God should come into the world,
   whom God ordained to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood,
   not of the Jew only, but also of the Greek, yea, of all them that were
   scattered abroad; then lo, it pleased the Lord to stir up the spirit of
   a Greek Prince (Greek for descent and language) even of Ptolemy
   Philadelph King of Egypt, to procure the translating of the Book of God
   out of Hebrew into Greek. This is the translation of the Seventy
   Interpreters, commonly so called, which prepared the way for our
   Saviour among the Gentiles by written preaching, as Saint John Baptist
   did among the Jews by vocal. For the Grecians being desirous of
   learning, were not wont to suffer books of worth to lie moulding in
   Kings' libraries, but had many of their servants, ready scribes, to
   copy them out, and so they were dispersed and made common. Again, the
   Greek tongue was well known and made familiar to most inhabitants in
   Asia, by reason of the conquest that there the Grecians had made, as
   also by the Colonies, which thither they had sent. For the same causes
   also it was well understood in many places of Europe, yea, and of
   Africa too. Therefore the word of God being set forth in Greek,
   becometh hereby like a candle set upon a candlestick, which giveth
   light to all that are in the house, or like a proclamation sounded
   forth in the market place, which most men presently take knowledge of;
   and therefore that language was fittest to contain the Scriptures, both
   for the first Preachers of the Gospel to appeal unto for witness, and
   for the learners also of those times to make search and trial by. It is
   certain, that that Translation was not so sound and so perfect, but it
   needed in many places correction; and who had been so sufficient for
   this work as the Apostles or Apostolic men? Yet it seemed good to the
   holy Ghost and to them, to take that which they found, (the same being
   for the greatest part true and sufficient) rather than making a new, in
   that new world and green age of the Church, to expose themselves to
   many exceptions and cavillations, as though they made a Translations to
   serve their own turn, and therefore bearing a witness to themselves,
   their witness not to be regarded. This may be supposed to be some
   cause, why the Translation of the Seventy was allowed to pass for
   current. Notwithstanding, though it was commended generally, yet it did
   not fully content the learned, no not of the Jews. For not long after
   Christ, Aquila fell in hand with a new Translation, and after him
   Theodotion, and after him Symmachus; yea, there was a fifth and a sixth
   edition, the Authors whereof were not known. [Epiphan. de mensur. et
   ponderibus.] These with the Seventy made up the Hexapla and were
   worthily and to great purpose compiled together by Origen. Howbeit the
   Edition of the Seventy went away with the credit, and therefore not
   only was placed in the midst by Origen (for the worth and excellency
   thereof above the rest, as Epiphanius gathered) but also was used by
   the Greek fathers for the ground and foundation of their Commentaries.
   Yea, Epiphanius above named doeth attribute so much unto it, that he
   holdeth the Authors thereof not only for Interpreters, but also for
   Prophets in some respect [S. August. 2::de dectrin. Christian c. 15];
   and Justinian the Emperor enjoining the Jews his subjects to use
   especially the Translation of the Seventy, rendreth this reason
   thereof, because they were as it were enlightened with prophetical
   grace. Yet for all that, as the Egyptians are said of the Prophet to be
   men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit [Isa 31:3]; so
   it is evident, (and Saint Jerome affirmeth as much) [S. Jerome. de
   optimo genere interpret.] that the Seventy were Interpreters, they were
   not Prophets; they did many things well, as learned men; but yet as men
   they stumbled and fell, one while through oversight, another while
   through ignorance, yea, sometimes they may be noted to add to the
   Original, and sometimes to take from it; which made the Apostles to
   leave them many times, when they left the Hebrew, and to deliver the
   sense thereof according to the truth of the word, as the spirit gave
   them utterance. This may suffice touching the Greek Translations of the
   Old Testament.

    TRANSLATION OUT OF HEBREW AND GREEK INTO LATIN

   There were also within a few hundred years after CHRIST, translations
   many into the Latin tongue: for this tongue also was very fit to convey
   the Law and the Gospel by, because in those times very many Countries
   of the West, yea of the South, East and North, spake or understood
   Latin, being made Provinces to the Romans. But now the Latin
   Translations were too many to be all good, for they were infinite
   (Latini Interprets nullo modo numerari possunt, saith S. Augustine.)
   [S. Augustin. de doctr. Christ. lib 2 cap II]. Again they were not out
   of the Hebrew fountain (we speak of the Latin Translations of the Old
   Testament) but out of the Greek stream, therefore the Greek being not
   altogether clear, the Latin derived from it must needs be muddy. This
   moved S. Jerome a most learned father, and the best linguist without
   controversy, of his age, or of any that went before him, to undertake
   the translating of the Old Testament, out of the very fountain with
   that evidence of great learning, judgment, industry, and faithfulness,
   that he had forever bound the Church unto him, in a debt of special
   remembrance and thankfulness.

    THE TRANSLATING OF THE SCRIPTURE INTO THE VULGAR TONGUES

   Now through the Church were thus furnished with Greek and Latin
   Translations, even before the faith of CHRIST was generally embraced in
   the Empire; (for the learned know that even in S. Jerome's time, the
   Consul of Rome and his wife were both Ethnics, and about the same time
   the greatest part of the Senate also) [S. Jerome. Marcell.Zosim] yet
   for all that the godly-learned were not content to have the Scriptures
   in the Language which they themselves understood, Greek and Latin, (as
   the good Lepers were not content to fare well themselves, but
   acquainted their neighbors with the store that God had sent, that they
   also might provide for themselves) [2 Kings 7:9] but also for the
   behoof and edifying of the unlearned which hungered and thirsted after
   righteousness, and had souls to be saved as well as they, they provided
   Translations into the vulgar for their Countrymen, insomuch that most
   nations under heaven did shortly after their conversion, hear CHRIST
   speaking unto them in their mother tongue, not by the voice of their
   Minister only, but also by the written word translated. If any doubt
   hereof, he may be satisfied by examples enough, if enough will serve
   the turn. First S. Jerome saith, Multarum gentium linguis Scriptura
   ante translata, docet falsa esse quae addita sunt, etc. i.e. "The
   Scripture being translated before in the languages of many Nations,
   doth show that those things that were added (by Lucian and Hesychius)
   are false." [S. Jerome. praef. in 4::Evangel.] So S. Jerome in that
   place. The same Jerome elsewhere affirmeth that he, the time was, had
   set forth the translation of the Seventy suae linguae hominibus, i.e.,
   for his countrymen of Dalmatia [S. Jerome. Sophronio.] Which words not
   only Erasmus doth understand to purport, that S. Jerome translated the
   Scripture into the Dalmatian tongue, but also Sixtus Senensis [Six.
   Sen. lib 4], and Alphonsus a` Castro [Alphon. lb 1 ca 23] (that we
   speak of no more) men not to be excepted against by them of Rome, do
   ingenuously confess as much. So, S. Chrysostom that lived in S.
   Jerome's time, giveth evidence with him: "The doctrine of S. John
   [saith he] did not in such sort [as the Philosophers' did] vanish away:
   but the Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Ethiopians, and infinite
   other nations being barbarous people translated it into their [mother]
   tongue, and have learned to be [true] Philosophers," he meaneth
   Christians. [S. Chrysost. in Johan. cap.I. hom.I.] To this may be added
   Theodoret, as next unto him, both for antiquity, and for learning. His
   words be these, "Every Country that is under the Sun, is full of these
   words (of the Apostles and Prophets) and the Hebrew tongue [he meaneth
   the Scriptures in the Hebrew tongue] is turned not only into the
   Language of the Grecians, but also of the Romans, and Egyptians, and
   Persians, and Indians, and Armenians, and Scythians, and Sauromatians,
   and briefly into all the Languages that any Nation useth. [Theodor. 5.
   Therapeut.] So he. In like manner, Ulfilas is reported by Paulus
   Diaconus and Isidor (and before them by Sozomen) to have translated the
   Scriptures into the Gothic tongue: [P. Diacon. li. 12.] John Bishop of
   Sevil by Vasseus, to have turned them into Arabic, about the year of
   our Lord 717; [Vaseus in Chron. Hispan.] Bede by Cistertiensis, to have
   turned a great part of them into Saxon: Efnard by Trithemius, to have
   abridged the French Psalter, as Beded had done the Hebrew, about the
   year 800: King Alfred by the said Cistertiensis, to have turned the
   Psalter into Saxon: [Polydor. Virg. 5 histor.] Methodius by Aventinus
   (printed at Ingolstadt) to have turned the Scriptures into Slavonian:
   [Aventin. lib. 4.] Valdo, Bishop of Frising by Beatus Rhenanus, to have
   caused about that time, the Gospels to be translated into Dutch rhythm,
   yet extant in the Library of Corbinian: [Circa annum 900. B. Rhenan.
   rerum German. lib 2.] Valdus, by divers to have turned them himself
   into French, about the year 1160: Charles the Fifth of that name,
   surnamed the Wise, to have caused them to be turned into French, about
   200 years after Valdus his time, of which translation there be many
   copies yet extant, as witnesseth Beroaldus. Much about that time, even
   in our King Richard the second's days, John Trevisa translated them
   into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be
   seen with divers, translated as it is very probable, in that age. So
   the Syrian translation of the New Testament is in most learned men's
   Libraries, of Widminstadius his setting forth, and the Psalter in
   Arabic is with many, of Augustinus Nebiensis' setting forth. So Postel
   affirmeth, that in his travel he saw the Gospels in the Ethiopian
   tongue; And Ambrose Thesius allegeth the Pslater of the Indians, which
   he testifieth to have been set forth by Potken in Syrian characters. So
   that, to have the Scriptures in the mother tongue is not a quaint
   conceit lately taken up, either by the Lord Cromwell in England,
   [Thuan.] or by the Lord Radevile in Polony, or by the Lord Ungnadius in
   the Emperor's dominion, but hath been thought upon, and put in practice
   of old, even from the first times of the conversion of any Nation; no
   doubt, because it was esteemed most profitable, to cause faith to grow
   in men's hearts the sooner, and to make them to be able to say with the
   words of the Psalms, "As we have heard, so we have seen." [Ps 48:8]

    THE UNWILLINGNESS OF OUR CHIEF ADVERSARIES, THAT THE SCRIPTURES SHOULD BE
    DIVULGED IN THE MOTHER TONGUE, ETC.

   Now the Church of Rome would seem at the length to bear a motherly
   affection towards her children, and to allow them the Scriptures in
   their mother tongue: but indeed it is a gift, not deserving to be
   called a gift, an unprofitable gift: [Sophecles] they must first get a
   licence in writing before they may use them, and to get that, they must
   approve themselves to their Confessor, that is, to be such as are, if
   not frozen in the dregs, yet soured with the leaven of their
   superstition. Howbeit, it seemed too much to Clement the Eighth that
   there should be any Licence granted to have them in the vulgar tongue,
   and therefore he overruleth and frustrateth the grant of Pius the
   Fourth. [See the observation (set forth by Clemen. His authority) upon
   the 4. rule of Pius the 4. his making in the index, lib. prohib. pag.
   15. ver. 5.] So much are they afraid of the light of the Scripture,
   (Lucifugae Scripturarum, as Tertulian speaketh) that they will not
   trust the people with it, no not as it is set forth by their own sworn
   men, no not with the Licence of their own Bishops and Inquisitors. Yea,
   so unwilling they are to communicate the Scriptures to the people's
   understanding in any sort, that they are not ashamed to confess, that
   we forced them to translate it into English against their wills. This
   seemeth to argue a bad cause, or a bad conscience, or both. Sure we
   are, that it is not he that hath good gold, that is afraid to bring it
   to the touchstone, but he that hath the counterfeit; [Tertul. de resur.
   carnis.] neither is it the true man that shunneth the light, but the
   malefactor, lest his deeds should be reproved [John 3:20]: neither is
   it the plaindealing Merchant that is unwilling to have the weights, or
   the meteyard brought in place, but he that useth deceit. But we will
   let them alone for this fault, and return to translation.

    THE SPEECHES AND REASONS, BOTH OF OUR BRETHREN, AND OF OUR ADVERSARIES
    AGAINST THIS WORK

   Many men's mouths have been open a good while (and yet are not stopped)
   with speeches about the Translation so long in hand, or rather perusals
   of Translations made before: and ask what may be the reason, what the
   necessity of the employment: Hath the Church been deceived, say they,
   all this while? Hath her sweet bread been mingled with leaven, here
   silver with dross, her wine with water, her milk with lime? (Lacte
   gypsum male miscetur, saith S. Ireney,) [S. Iren. 3. lib. cap. 19.] We
   hoped that we had been in the right way, that we had the Oracles of God
   delivered unto us, and that though all the world had cause to be
   offended and to complain, yet that we had none. Hath the nurse holden
   out the breast, and nothing but wind in it? Hath the bread been
   delivered by the fathers of the Church, and the same proved to be
   lapidosus, as Seneca speaketh? What is it to handle the word of God
   deceitfully, if this be not? Thus certain brethren. Also the
   adversaries of Judah and Jerusalem, like Sanballat in Nehemiah, mock,
   as we hear, both the work and the workmen, saying; "What do these weak
   Jews, etc. will they make the stones whole again out of the heaps of
   dust which are burnt? although they build, yet if a fox go up, he shall
   even break down their stony wall." [Neh 4:3] Was their Translation good
   before? Why do they now mend it? Was it not good? Why then was it
   obtruded to the people? Yea, why did the Catholics (meaning Popish
   Romanists) always go in jeopardy, for refusing to go to hear it? Nay,
   if it must be translated into English, Catholics are fittest to do it.
   They have learning, and they know when a thing is well, they can manum
   de tabula. We will answer them both briefly: and the former, being
   brethren, thus, with S. Jerome, "Damnamus veteres? Mineme, sed post
   priorum studia in domo Domini quod possums laboramus." [S. Jerome.
   Apolog. advers. Ruffin.] That is, "Do we condemn the ancient? In no
   case: but after the endeavors of them that were before us, we take the
   best pains we can in the house of God." As if he said, Being provoked
   by the example of the learned men that lived before my time, I have
   thought it my duty, to assay whether my talent in the knowledge of the
   tongues, may be profitable in any measure to God's Church, lest I
   should seem to laboured in them in vain, and lest I should be thought
   to glory in men, (although ancient,) above that which was in them. Thus
   S. Jerome may be thought to speak.

    A SATISFACTION TO OUR BRETHREN

   And to the same effect say we, that we are so far off from condemning
   any of their labors that travailed before us in this kind, either in
   this land or beyond sea, either in King Henry's time, or King Edward's
   (if there were any translation, or correction of a translation in his
   time) or Queen Elizabeth's of ever renowned memory, that we acknowledge
   them to have been raised up of God, for the building and furnishing of
   his Church, and that they deserve to be had of us and of posterity in
   everlasting remembrance. The judgment of Aristotle is worthy and well
   known: "If Timotheus had not been, we had not had much sweet music; but
   if Phrynis [Timotheus his master] had not been, we had not had
   Timotheus." Therefore blessed be they, and most honoured be their name,
   that break the ice, and giveth onset upon that which helpeth forward to
   the saving of souls. Now what can be more available thereto, than to
   deliver God's book unto God's people in a tongue which they understand?
   Since of a hidden treasure, and of a fountain that is sealed, there is
   no profit, as Ptolemy Philadelph wrote to the Rabbins or masters of the
   Jews, as witnesseth Epiphanius: [S. Epiphan. loco ante citato.] and as
   S. Augustine saith; "A man had rather be with his dog than with a
   stranger (whose tongue is strange unto him)." [S. Augustin. lib. 19. de
   civil. Dei. c. 7.] Yet for all that, as nothing is begun and perfected
   at the same time, and the later thoughts are thought to be the wiser:
   so, if we building upon their foundation that went before us, and being
   holpen by their labours, do endeavor to make that better which they
   left so good; no man, we are sure, hath cause to mislike us; they, we
   persuade ourselves, if they were alive, would thank us. The vintage of
   Abienzer, that strake the stroke: yet the gleaning of grapes of Ephraim
   was not to be despised. See Judges 8:2. Joash the king of Israel did
   not satisfy himself, till he had smitten the ground three times; and
   yet he offended the Prophet, for giving over then. [2 Kings 13:18-19]
   Aquila, of whom we spake before, translated the Bible as carefully, and
   as skilfully as he could; and yet he thought good to go over it again,
   and then it got the credit with the Jews, to be called accurately done,
   as Saint Jerome witnesseth. [S. Jerome. in Ezech. cap. 3.] How many
   books of profane learning have been gone over again and again, by the
   same translators, by others? Of one and the same book of Aristotle's
   Ethics, there are extant not so few as six or seven several
   translations. Now if this cost may be bestowed upon the gourd, which
   affordeth us a little shade, and which today flourisheth, but tomorrow
   is cut down; what may we bestow, nay what ought we not to bestow upon
   the Vine, the fruit whereof maketh glad the conscience of man, and the
   stem whereof abideth forever? And this is the word of God, which we
   translate. "What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?" [Jer
   23:28] Tanti vitreum, quanti verum margaritum (saith Tertullian,)
   [Tertul. ad Martyr.] if a toy of glass be of that reckoning with us,
   how ought we to value the true pearl? [Jerome. ad Salvin.] Therefore
   let no man's eye be evil, because his Majesty's is good; neither let
   any be grieved, that we have a Prince that seeketh the increase of the
   spiritual wealth of Israel (let Sanballats and Tobiahs do so, which
   therefore do bear their just reproof) but let us rather bless God from
   the ground of our heart, for working this religious care in him, to
   have the translations of the Bible maturely considered of and examined.
   For by this means it cometh to pass, that whatsoever is sound already
   (and all is sound for substance, in one or other of our editions, and
   the worst of ours far better than their authentic vulgar) the same will
   shine as gold more brightly, being rubbed and polished; also, if
   anything be halting, or superfluous, or not so agreeable to the
   original, the same may be corrected, and the truth set in place. And
   what can the King command to be done, that will bring him more true
   honour than this? and wherein could they that have been set a work,
   approve their duty to the King, yea their obedience to God, and love to
   his Saints more, than by yielding their service, and all that is within
   them, for the furnishing of the work? But besides all this, they were
   the principal motives of it, and therefore ought least to quarrel it:
   for the very Historical truth is, that upon the importunate petitions
   of the Puritans, at his Majesty's coming to this Crown, the Conference
   at Hampton Court having been appointed for hearing their complaints:
   when by force of reason they were put from other grounds, they had
   recourse at the last, to this shift, that they could not with good
   conscience subscribe to the Communion book, since it maintained the
   Bible as it was there translated, which was as they said, a most
   corrupted translation. And although this was judged to be but a very
   poor and empty shift; yet even hereupon did his Majesty begin to
   bethink himself of the good that might ensue by a new translation, and
   presently after gave order for this Translation which is now presented
   unto thee. Thus much to satisfy our scrupulous Brethren.

    AN ANSWER TO THE IMPUTATIONS OF OUR ADVERSARIES

   Now to the latter we answer; that we do not deny, nay we affirm and
   avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set
   forth by men of our profession, (for we have seen none of theirs of the
   whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of
   God. As the King's speech, which he uttereth in Parliament, being
   translated into French, Dutch, Italian, and Latin, is still the King's
   speech, though it be not interpreted by every Translator with the like
   grace, nor peradventure so fitly for phrase, nor so expressly for
   sense, everywhere. For it is confessed, that things are to take their
   denomination of the greater part; and a natural man could say, Verum
   ubi multa nitent in carmine, non ego paucis offendor maculis, etc.
   [Horace.] A man may be counted a virtuous man, though he have made many
   slips in his life, (else, there were none virtuous, for in many things
   we offend all) [James 3:2] also a comely man and lovely, though he have
   some warts upon his hand, yea, not only freckles upon his face, but
   also scars. No cause therefore why the word translated should be denied
   to be the word, or forbidden to be current, notwithstanding that some
   imperfections and blemishes may be noted in the setting forth of it.
   For whatever was perfect under the Sun, where Apostles or Apostolic
   men, that is, men endued with an extraordinary measure of God's spirit,
   and privileged with the privilege of infallibility, had not their hand?
   The Romanists therefore in refusing to hear, and daring to burn the
   Word translated, did no less than despite the spirit of grace, from
   whom originally it proceeded, and whose sense and meaning, as well as
   man's weakness would enable, it did express. Judge by an example or
   two. Plutarch writeth, that after that Rome had been burnt by the
   Gauls, they fell soon to build it again: but doing it in haste, they
   did not cast the streets, nor proportion the houses in such comely
   fashion, as had been most slightly and convenient; [Plutarch in
   Camillo.] was Catiline therefore an honest man, or a good patriot, that
   sought to bring it to a combustion? or Nero a good Prince, that did
   indeed set it on fire? So, by the story of Ezra, and the prophecy of
   Haggai it may be gathered, that the Temple built by Zerubbabel after
   the return from Babylon, was by no means to be compared to the former
   built by Solomon (for they that remembered the former, wept when they
   considered the latter) [Ezra 3:12] notwithstanding, might this latter
   either have been abhorred and forsaken by the Jews, or profaned by the
   Greeks? The like we are to think of Translations. The translation of
   the Seventy dissenteth from the Original in many places, neither doth
   it come near it, for perspicuity, gravity, majesty; yet which of the
   Apostles did condemn it? Condemn it? Nay, they used it, (as it is
   apparent, and as Saint Jerome and most learned men do confess) which
   they would not have done, nor by their example of using it, so grace
   and commend it to the Church, if it had been unworthy of the
   appellation and name of the word of God. And whereas they urge for
   their second defence of their vilifying and abusing of the English
   Bibles, or some pieces thereof, which they meet with, for that heretics
   (forsooth) were the Authors of the translations, (heretics they call us
   by the same right that they call themselves Catholics, both being
   wrong) we marvel what divinity taught them so. We are sure Tertullian
   was of another mind: Ex personis probamus fidem, an ex fide personas?
   [Tertul. de praescript. contra haereses.] Do we try men's faith by
   their persons? we should try their persons by their faith. Also S.
   Augustine was of another mind: for he lighting upon certain rules made
   by Tychonius a Donatist, for the better understanding of the word, was
   not ashamed to make use of them, yea, to insert them into his own book,
   with giving commendation to them so far forth as they were worthy to be
   commended, as is to be seen in S. Augustine's third book De doctrina
   Christiana. [S. August. 3. de doct. Christ. cap. 30.] To be short,
   Origen, and the whole Church of God for certain hundred years, were of
   another mind: for they were so far from treading under foot, (much more
   from burning) the Translation of Aquila a Proselyte, that is, one that
   had turned Jew; of Symmachus, and Theodotion, both Ebionites, that is,
   most vile heretics, that they joined together with the Hebrew Original,
   and the Translation of the Seventy (as hath been before signified out
   of Epiphanius) and set them forth openly to be considered of and
   perused by all. But we weary the unlearned, who need not know so much,
   and trouble the learned, who know it already.

   Yet before we end, we must answer a third cavil and objection of theirs
   against us, for altering and amending our Translations so oft; wherein
   truly they deal hardly, and strangely with us. For to whomever was it
   imputed for a fault (by such as were wise) to go over that which he had
   done, and to amend it where he saw cause? Saint Augustine was not
   afraid to exhort S. Jerome to a Palinodia or recantation; [S. Aug.
   Epist. 9.] and doth even glory that he seeth his infirmities. [S. Aug.
   Epist. 8.] If we be sons of the Truth, we must consider what it
   speaketh, and trample upon our own credit, yea, and upon other men's
   too, if either be any way an hindrance to it. This to the cause: then
   to the persons we say, that of all men they ought to be most silent in
   this case. For what varieties have they, and what alterations have they
   made, not only of their Service books, Portesses and Breviaries, but
   also of their Latin Translation? The Service book supposed to be made
   by S. Ambrose (Officium Ambrosianum) was a great while in special use
   and request; but Pope Hadrian calling a Council with the aid of Charles
   the Emperor, abolished it, yea, burnt it, and commanded the Service
   book of Saint Gregory universally to be used. [Durand. lib. 5. cap. 2.]
   Well, Officium Gregorianum gets by this means to be in credit, but doth
   it continue without change or altering? No, the very Roman Service was
   of two fashions, the New fashion, and the Old, (the one used in one
   Church, the other in another) as is to be seen in Pamelius a Romanist,
   his Preface, before Micrologus. the same Pamelius reporteth out
   Radulphus de Rivo, that about the year of our Lord, 1277, Pope Nicolas
   the Third removed out of the Churches of Rome, the more ancient books
   (of Service) and brought into use the Missals of the Friers Minorites,
   and commanded them to be observed there; insomuch that about an hundred
   years after, when the above name Radulphus happened to be at Rome, he
   found all the books to be new, (of the new stamp). Neither were there
   this chopping and changing in the more ancient times only, but also of
   late: Pius Quintus himself confesseth, that every Bishopric almost had
   a peculiar kind of service, most unlike to that which others had: which
   moved him to abolish all other Breviaries, though never so ancient, and
   privileged and published by Bishops in their Dioceses, and to establish
   and ratify that only which was of his own setting forth, in the year
   1568. Now when the father of their Church, who gladly would heal the
   sore of the daughter of his people softly and slightly, and make the
   best of it, findeth so great fault with them for their odds and
   jarring; we hope the children have no great cause to vaunt of their
   uniformity. But the difference that appeareth between our Translations,
   and our often correcting of them, is the thing that we are specially
   charged with; let us see therefore whether they themselves be without
   fault this way, (if it be to be counted a fault, to correct) and
   whether they be fit men to throw stones at us: O tandem maior parcas
   insane minori: they that are less sound themselves, out not to object
   infirmities to others. [Horat.] If we should tell them that Valla,
   Stapulensis, Erasmus, and Vives found fault with their vulgar
   Translation, and consequently wished the same to be mended, or a new
   one to be made, they would answer peradventure, that we produced their
   enemies for witnesses against them; albeit, they were in no other sort
   enemies, than as S. Paul was to the Galatians, for telling them the
   truth [Gal 4:16]: and it were to be wished, that they had dared to tell
   it them plainlier and oftener. But what will they say to this, that
   Pope Leo the Tenth allowed Erasmus' Translation of the New Testament,
   so much different from the vulgar, by his Apostolic Letter and Bull;
   that the same Leo exhorted Pagnine to translate the whole Bible, and
   bare whatsoever charges was necessary for the work? [Sixtus Senens.]
   Surely, as the Apostle reasoneth to the Hebrews, that if the former Law
   and Testament had been sufficient, there had been no need of the
   latter: [Heb 7:11 and 8:7] so we may say, that if the old vulgar had
   been at all points allowable, to small purpose had labour and charges
   been undergone, about framing of a new. If they say, it was one Pope's
   private opinion, and that he consulted only himself; then we are able
   to go further with them, and to aver, that more of their chief men of
   all sorts, even their own Trent champions Paiva and Vega, and their own
   Inquisitors, Hieronymus ab Oleastro, and their own Bishop Isidorus
   Clarius, and their own Cardinal Thomas a Vio Caietan, do either make
   new Translations themselves, or follow new ones of other men's making,
   or note the vulgar Interpreter for halting; none of them fear to
   dissent from him, nor yet to except against him. And call they this an
   uniform tenor of text and judgment about the text, so many of their
   Worthies disclaiming the now received conceit? Nay, we will yet come
   nearer the quick: doth not their Paris edition differ from the Lovaine,
   and Hentenius his from them both, and yet all of them allowed by
   authority? Nay, doth not Sixtus Quintus confess, that certain Catholics
   (he meaneth certain of his own side) were in such an humor of
   translating the Scriptures into Latin, that Satan taking occasion by
   them, though they thought of no such matter, did strive what he could,
   out of so uncertain and manifold a variety of Translations, so to
   mingle all things, that nothing might seem to be left certain and firm
   in them, etc.? [Sixtus 5. praefat. fixa Bibliis.] Nay, further, did not
   the same Sixtus ordain by an inviolable decree, and that with the
   counsel and consent of his Cardinals, that the Latin edition of the old
   and new Testament, which the Council of Trent would have to be
   authentic, is the same without controversy which he then set forth,
   being diligently corrected and printed in the Printinghouse of Vatican?
   Thus Sixtus in his Preface before his Bible. And yet Clement the Eighth
   his immediate successor, published another edition of the Bible,
   containing in it infinite differences from that of Sixtus, (and many of
   them weighty and material) and yet this must be authentic by all means.
   What is to have the faith of our glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST with Yea or
   Nay, if this be not? Again, what is sweet harmony and consent, if this
   be? Therefore, as Demaratus of Corinth advised a great King, before he
   talked of the dissensions of the Grecians, to compose his domestic
   broils (for at that time his Queen and his son and heir were at deadly
   feud with him) so all the while that our adversaries do make so many
   and so various editions themselves, and do jar so much about the worth
   and authority of them, they can with no show of equity challenge us for
   changing and correcting.

    THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSLATORS, WITH THEIR NUMBER, FURNITURE, CARE, ETC.

   But it is high time to leave them, and to show in brief what we
   proposed to ourselves, and what course we held in this our perusal and
   survey of the Bible. Truly (good Christian Reader) we never thought
   from the beginning, that we should need to make a new Translation, nor
   yet to make of a bad one a good one, (for then the imputation of Sixtus
   had been true in some sort, that our people had been fed with gall of
   Dragons instead of wine, with whey instead of milk:) but to make a good
   one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one, not
   justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavor, that our
   mark. To that purpose there were many chosen, that were greater in
   other men's eyes than in their own, and that sought the truth rather
   than their own praise. Again, they came or were thought to come to the
   work, not exercendi causa (as one saith) but exercitati, that is,
   learned, not to learn: For the chief overseer and [NOTE: Greek letters
   omitted] under his Majesty, to whom not only we, but also our whole
   Church was much bound, knew by his wisdom, which thing also Nazianzen
   taught so long ago, that it is a preposterous order to teach first and
   to learn after, yea that [NOTE: Greek letters omitted] to learn and
   practice together, is neither commendable for the workman, nor safe for
   the work. [Idem in Apologet.] Therefore such were thought upon, as
   could say modestly with Saint Jerome, Et Hebreaeum Sermonem ex parte
   didicimus, et in Latino pene ab ipsis incunabulis etc. detriti sumus.
   "Both we have learned the Hebrew tongue in part, and in the Latin we
   have been exercised almost from our very cradle." S. Jerome maketh no
   mention of the Greek tongue, wherein yet he did excel, because he
   translated not the old Testament out of Greek, but out of Hebrew. And
   in what sort did these assemble? In the trust of their own knowledge,
   or of their sharpness of wit, or deepness of judgment, as it were in an
   arm of flesh? At no hand. They trusted in him that hath the key of
   David, opening and no man shutting; they prayed to the Lord the Father
   of our Lord, to the effect that S. Augustine did; "O let thy Scriptures
   be my pure delight, let me not be deceived in them, neither let me
   deceive by them." [S. Aug. lib. II. Confess. cap. 2.] In this
   confidence, and with this devotion did they assemble together; not too
   many, lest one should trouble another; and yet many, lest many things
   haply might escape them. If you ask what they had before them, truly it
   was the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, the Greek of the New. These
   are the two golden pipes, or rather conduits, where-through the olive
   branches empty themselves into the gold. Saint Augustine calleth them
   precedent, or original tongues; [S. August. 3. de doctr. c. 3. etc.]
   Saint Jerome, fountains. [S. Jerome. ad Suniam et Fretel.] The same
   Saint Jerome affirmeth, [S. Jerome. ad Lucinium, Dist. 9 ut veterum.]
   and Gratian hath not spared to put it into his Decree, That "as the
   credit of the old Books" (he meaneth of the Old Testament) "is to be
   tried by the Hebrew Volumes, so of the New by the Greek tongue," he
   meaneth by the original Greek. If truth be tried by these tongues, then
   whence should a Translation be made, but out of them? These tongues
   therefore, the Scriptures we say in those tongues, we set before us to
   translate, being the tongues wherein God was pleased to speak to his
   Church by the Prophets and Apostles. Neither did we run over the work
   with that posting haste that the Septuagint did, if that be true which
   is reported of them, that they finished it in 72 days; [Joseph. Antiq.
   lib. 12.] neither were we barred or hindered from going over it again,
   having once done it, like S. Jerome, if that be true which himself
   reporteth, that he could no sooner write anything, but presently it was
   caught from him, and published, and he could not have leave to mend it:
   [S. Jerome. ad Pammac. pro libr. advers. Iovinian.] neither, to be
   short, were we the first that fell in hand with translating the
   Scripture into English, and consequently destitute of former helps, as
   it is written of Origen, that he was the first in a manner, that put
   his hand to write Commentaries upon the Scriptures, [Sophoc. in Elect.]
   and therefore no marvel, if he overshot himself many times. None of
   these things: the work hath not been huddled up in 72 days, but hath
   cost the workmen, as light as it seemeth, the pains of twice seven
   times seventy two days and more: matters of such weight and consequence
   are to be speeded with maturity: for in a business of movement a man
   feareth not the blame of convenient slackness. [S. Chrysost. in II.
   Thess. cap. 2.] Neither did we think much to consult the Translators or
   Commentators, Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek or Latin, no nor the
   Spanish, French, Italian, or Dutch; neither did we disdain to revise
   that which we had done, and to bring back to the anvil that which we
   had hammered: but having and using as great helps as were needful, and
   fearing no reproach for slowness, nor coveting praise for expedition,
   we have at length, through the good hand of the Lord upon us, brought
   the work to that pass that you see.

    REASONS MOVING US TO SET DIVERSITY OF SENSES IN THE MARGIN, WHERE THERE IS
    GREAT PROBABILITY FOR EACH

   Some peradventure would have no variety of senses to be set in the
   margin, lest the authority of the Scriptures for deciding of
   controversies by that show of uncertainty, should somewhat be shaken.
   But we hold their judgment not to be sound in this point. For though,
   "whatsoever things are necessary are manifest," as S. Chrysostom saith,
   [S. Chrysost. in II. Thess. cap. 2.] and as S. Augustine, "In those
   things that are plainly set down in the Scriptures, all such matters
   are found that concern Faith, Hope, and Charity. [S. Aug. 2. de doctr.
   Christ. cap. 9.] Yet for all that it cannot be dissembled, that partly
   to exercise and whet our wits, partly to wean the curious from the
   loathing of them for their everywhere plainness, partly also to stir up
   our devotion to crave the assistance of God's spirit by prayer, and
   lastly, that we might be forward to seek aid of our brethren by
   conference, and never scorn those that be not in all respects so
   complete as they should be, being to seek in many things ourselves, it
   hath pleased God in his divine providence, here and there to scatter
   words and sentences of that difficulty and doubtfulness, not in
   doctrinal points that concern salvation, (for in such it hath been
   vouched that the Scriptures are plain) but in matters of less moment,
   that fearfulness would better beseem us than confidence, and if we will
   resolve upon modesty with S. Augustine, (though not in this same case
   altogether, yet upon the same ground) Melius est debitare de occultis,
   quam litigare de incertis, [S. Aug li. S. de Genes. ad liter. cap. 5.]
   "it is better to make doubt of those things which are secret, than to
   strive about those things that are uncertain." There be many words in
   the Scriptures, which be never found there but once, (having neither
   brother or neighbor, as the Hebrews speak) so that we cannot be holpen
   by conference of places. Again, there be many rare names of certain
   birds, beasts and precious stones, etc. concerning the Hebrews
   themselves are so divided among themselves for judgment, that they may
   seem to have defined this or that, rather because they would say
   something, than because they were sure of that which they said, as S.
   Jerome somewhere saith of the Septuagint. Now in such a case, doth not
   a margin do well to admonish the Reader to seek further, and not to
   conclude or dogmatize upon this or that peremptorily? For as it is a
   fault of incredulity, to doubt of those things that are evident: so to
   determine of such things as the Spirit of God hath left (even in the
   judgment of the judicious) questionable, can be no less than
   presumption. Therefore as S. Augustine saith, that variety of
   Translations is profitable for the finding out of the sense of the
   Scriptures: [S. Aug. 2. De doctr. Christian. cap. 14.] so diversity of
   signification and sense in the margin, where the text is no so clear,
   must needs do good, yea, is necessary, as we are persuaded. We know
   that Sixtus Quintus expressly forbiddeth, that any variety of readings
   of their vulgar edition, should be put in the margin, [Sixtus 5. praef.
   Bibliae.] (which though it be not altogether the same thing to that we
   have in hand, yet it looketh that way) but we think he hath not all of
   his own side his favorers, for this conceit. They that are wise, had
   rather have their judgments at liberty in differences of readings, than
   to be captivated to one, when it may be the other. If they were sure
   that their high Priest had all laws shut up in his breast, as Paul the
   Second bragged, [Plat. in Paulo secundo.] and that he were as free from
   error by special privilege, as the Dictators of Rome were made by law
   inviolable, it were another matter; then his word were an Oracle, his
   opinion a decision. But the eyes of the world are now open, God be
   thanked, and have been a great while, they find that he is subject to
   the same affections and infirmities that others be, that his skin is
   penetrable, and therefore so much as he proveth, not as much as he
   claimeth, they grant and embrace.

    REASONS INDUCING US NOT TO STAND CURIOUSLY UPON AN IDENTITY OF PHRASING

   Another things we think good to admonish thee of (gentle Reader) that
   we have not tied ourselves to an uniformity of phrasing, or to an
   identity of words, as some peradventure would wish that we had done,
   because they observe, that some learned men somewhere, have been as
   exact as they could that way. Truly, that we might not vary from the
   sense of that which we had translated before, if the word signified
   that same in both places (for there be some words that be not the same
   sense everywhere) we were especially careful, and made a conscience,
   according to our duty. But, that we should express the same notion in
   the same particular word; as for example, if we translate the Hebrew or
   Greek word once by PURPOSE, never to call it INTENT; if one where
   JOURNEYING, never TRAVELING; if one where THINK, never SUPPOSE; if one
   where PAIN, never ACHE; if one where JOY, never GLADNESS, etc. Thus to
   mince the matter, we thought to savour more of curiosity than wisdom,
   and that rather it would breed scorn in the Atheist, than bring profit
   to the godly Reader. For is the kingdom of God to become words or
   syllables? why should we be in bondage to them if we may be free, use
   one precisely when we may use another no less fit, as commodiously? A
   godly Father in the Primitive time showed himself greatly moved, that
   one of newfangledness called [NOTE: Greek omitted but was a dispute
   over the word for "a bed"] [Niceph. Calist. lib.8. cap.42.] though the
   difference be little or none; and another reporteth that he was much
   abused for turning "Cucurbita" (to which reading the people had been
   used) into "Hedera". [S. Jerome in 4. Ionae. See S. Aug: epist. 10.]
   Now if this happens in better times, and upon so small occasions, we
   might justly fear hard censure, if generally we should make verbal and
   unnecessary changings. We might also be charged (by scoffers) with some
   unequal dealing towards a great number of good English words. For as it
   is written of a certain great Philosopher, that he should say , that
   those logs were happy that were made images to be worshipped; for their
   fellows, as good as they, lay for blocks behind the fire: so if we
   should say, as it were, unto certain words, Stand up higher, have a
   place in the Bible always, and to others of like quality, Get ye hence,
   be banished forever, we might be taxed peradventure with S. James his
   words, namely, "To be partial in ourselves and judges of evil
   thoughts." Add hereunto, that niceness in words was always counted the
   next step to trifling, and so was to be curious about names too: also
   that we cannot follow a better pattern for elocution than God himself;
   therefore he using divers words, in his holy writ, and indifferently
   for one thing in nature: [see Euseb. li. 12. ex Platon.] we, if we will
   not be superstitious, may use the same liberty in our English versions
   out of Hebrew and Greek, for that copy or store that he hath given us.
   Lastly, we have on the one side avoided the scrupulosity of the
   Puritans, who leave the old Ecclesiastical words, and betake them to
   other, as when they put WASHING for BAPTISM, and CONGREGATION instead
   of CHURCH: as also on the other side we have shunned the obscurity of
   the Papists, in their AZIMES, TUNIKE, RATIONAL, HOLOCAUSTS, PRAEPUCE,
   PASCHE, and a number of such like, whereof their late Translation is
   full, and that of purpose to darken the sense, that since they must
   needs translate the Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may be kept
   from being understood. But we desire that the Scripture may speak like
   itself, as in the language of Canaan, that it may be understood even of
   the very vulgar.

   Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we
   had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that
   we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able
   to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from
   our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may
   understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our
   affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto
   fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into
   them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with
   the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you
   may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O
   despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot
   so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy
   things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our
   coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a
   mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not
   darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not
   naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, "It is
   a grievous thing" (or dangerous) "to neglect a great fair, and to seek
   to make markets afterwards: also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom,
   "It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober" (and watchful)
   "should at any time be neglected:" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap.
   14. oral. 26.] Lastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine,
   "They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will
   taking vengeance of them." [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object.
   Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
   God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to
   everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to
   hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he
   stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are
   to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to
   know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the
   appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all
   praise and thanksgiving.

   Amen.

Genesis

    Chapter 1

   In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

   ^2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
   face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
   waters.

   ^3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

   ^4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
   from the darkness.

   ^5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And
   the evening and the morning were the first day.

   ^6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
   and let it divide the waters from the waters.

   ^7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under
   the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it
   was so.

   ^8And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning
   were the second day.

   ^9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
   unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

   ^10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the
   waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

   ^11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
   seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is
   in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

   ^12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
   kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
   kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^13And the evening and the morning were the third day.

   ^14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
   divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
   seasons, and for days, and years:

   ^15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give
   light upon the earth: and it was so.

   ^16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
   and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

   ^17And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon
   the earth,

   ^18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light
   from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

   ^19And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

   ^20And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
   creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
   open firmament of heaven.

   ^21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
   which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every
   winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
   the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

   ^23And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

   ^24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
   his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
   kind: and it was so.

   ^25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
   their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
   kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and
   let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
   the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

   ^27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
   him; male and female created he them.

   ^28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
   multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
   over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
   living thing that moveth upon the earth.

   ^29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
   which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
   is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

   ^30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and
   to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I
   have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

   ^31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very
   good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

   ^2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he
   rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

   ^3And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in
   it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

   ^4These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
   were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the
   heavens,

   ^5And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
   herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to
   rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

   ^6But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face
   of the ground.

   ^7And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
   into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

   ^8And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
   the man whom he had formed.

   ^9And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is
   pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
   midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

   ^10And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it
   was parted, and became into four heads.

   ^11The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
   whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

   ^12And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx
   stone.

   ^13And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
   compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

   ^14And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth
   toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

   ^15And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden
   to dress it and to keep it.

   ^16And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
   garden thou mayest freely eat:

   ^17But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not
   eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
   die.

   ^18And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone;
   I will make him an help meet for him.

   ^19And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field,
   and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he
   would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
   was the name thereof.

   ^20And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and
   to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help
   meet for him.

   ^21And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
   slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
   thereof;

   ^22And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman,
   and brought her unto the man.

   ^23And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
   she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

   ^24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
   cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

   ^25And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
   ashamed.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the
   Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
   shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

   ^2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the
   trees of the garden:

   ^3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God
   hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye
   die.

   ^4And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

   ^5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
   shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

   ^6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
   was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise,
   she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her
   husband with her; and he did eat.

   ^7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
   naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

   ^8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the
   cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence
   of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

   ^9And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

   ^10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
   because I was naked; and I hid myself.

   ^11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of
   the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

   ^12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave
   me of the tree, and I did eat.

   ^13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
   done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

   ^14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this,
   thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
   upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
   thy life:

   ^15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
   seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
   heel.

   ^16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
   conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
   shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

   ^17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
   thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
   saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
   sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

   ^18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou
   shalt eat the herb of the field;

   ^19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
   the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto
   dust shalt thou return.

   ^20And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of
   all living.

   ^21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins,
   and clothed them.

   ^22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
   know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
   of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

   ^23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to
   till the ground from whence he was taken.

   ^24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of
   Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the
   way of the tree of life.

    Chapter 4

   And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said,
   I have gotten a man from the Lord.

   ^2And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep,
   but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

   ^3And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
   fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.

   ^4And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
   fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

   ^5But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was
   very wroth, and his countenance fell.

   ^6And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
   countenance fallen?

   ^7If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not
   well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and
   thou shalt rule over him.

   ^8And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they
   were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew
   him.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said,
   I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

   ^10And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood
   crieth unto me from the ground.

   ^11And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth
   to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

   ^12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto
   thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the
   earth.

   ^13And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can
   bear.

   ^14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth;
   and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a
   vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that
   findeth me shall slay me.

   ^15And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
   vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon
   Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

   ^16And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the
   land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

   ^17And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
   builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
   son, Enoch.

   ^18And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael
   begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

   ^19And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
   and the name of the other Zillah.

   ^20And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
   and of such as have cattle.

   ^21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as
   handle the harp and organ.

   ^22And Zillah, she also bare Tubal- cain, an instructer of every
   artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

   ^23And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye
   wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my
   wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

   ^24If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
   sevenfold.

   ^25And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his
   name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of
   Abel, whom Cain slew.

   ^26And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
   name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.

    Chapter 5

   This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
   created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

   ^2Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their
   name Adam, in the day when they were created.

   ^3And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his
   own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:

   concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which
   the Lord hath cursed.

   ^30And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five

   years: and he died.

   ^32And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and
   Japheth.

    Chapter 6

   And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
   earth, and daughters were born unto them,

   ^2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair;
   and they took them wives of all which they chose.

   ^3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
   that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
   years.

   ^4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
   when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
   children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
   renown.

   ^5And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
   that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually.

   ^6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it
   grieved him at his heart.

   ^7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
   face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the
   fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

   ^8But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

   ^9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in
   his generations, and Noah walked with God.

   ^10And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

   ^11The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with
   violence.

   ^12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all
   flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

   ^13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for
   the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will
   destroy them with the earth.

   ^14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark,
   and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

   ^15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of
   the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits,
   and the height of it thirty cubits.

   ^16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
   finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
   thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

   ^17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,
   to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven;
   and every thing that is in the earth shall die.

   ^18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into
   the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with
   thee.

   ^19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou
   bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male
   and female.

   ^20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every
   creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall
   come unto thee, to keep them alive.

   ^21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
   gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

   ^22Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark;
   for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

   ^2Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and
   his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his
   female.

   ^3Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep
   seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

   ^4For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty
   days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will
   I destroy from off the face of the earth.

   ^5And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him.

   ^6And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon
   the earth.

   ^7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

   ^8Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and
   of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

   ^9There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the
   female, as God had commanded Noah.

   ^10And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood
   were upon the earth.

   ^11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
   seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of
   the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

   ^12And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

   ^13In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
   the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with
   them, into the ark;

   ^14They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their
   kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
   kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.

   ^15And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh,
   wherein is the breath of life.

   ^16And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God
   had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in.

   ^17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
   increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

   ^18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth;
   and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

   ^19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
   high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.

   ^20Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
   covered.

   ^21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
   cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon
   the earth, and every man:

   ^22All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the
   dry land, died.

   ^23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of
   the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl
   of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only
   remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

   ^24And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
   that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the
   earth, and the waters asswaged;

   ^2The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
   stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

   ^3And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the
   end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

   ^4And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
   the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

   ^5And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
   tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the
   mountains seen.

   ^6And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
   window of the ark which he had made:

   ^7And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the
   waters were dried up from off the earth.

   ^8Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated
   from off the face of the ground;

   ^9But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned
   unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole
   earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto
   him into the ark.

   ^10And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove
   out of the ark;

   ^11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
   was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated
   from off the earth.

   ^12And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which
   returned not again unto him any more.

   ^13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
   first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from
   off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,
   and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

   ^14And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
   month, was the earth dried.

   ^15And God spake unto Noah, saying,

   ^16Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons'
   wives with thee.

   ^17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all
   flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that
   creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth,
   and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

   ^18And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him:

   ^19Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
   creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

   ^20And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean
   beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
   altar.

   ^21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart,
   I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the
   imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again
   smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

   ^22While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat,
   and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and
   multiply, and replenish the earth.

   ^2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of
   the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon
   the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they
   delivered.

   ^3Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
   green herb have I given you all things.

   ^4But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye
   not eat.

   ^5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
   every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of
   every man's brother will I require the life of man.

   ^6Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
   the image of God made he man.

   ^7And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the
   earth, and multiply therein.

   ^8And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

   ^9And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed
   after you;

   ^10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the
   cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out
   of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

   ^11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh
   be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any
   more be a flood to destroy the earth.

   ^12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between
   me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual
   generations:

   ^13I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
   covenant between me and the earth.

   ^14And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that
   the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

   ^15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and
   every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become
   a flood to destroy all flesh.

   ^16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I
   may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living
   creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

   ^17And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I
   have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

   ^18And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
   Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

   ^19These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
   overspread.

   ^20And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

   ^21And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
   within his tent.

   ^22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and
   told his two brethren without.

   ^23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
   shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their
   father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's
   nakedness.

   ^24And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done
   unto him.

   ^25And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
   unto his brethren.

   ^26And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
   his servant.

   ^27God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
   and Canaan shall be his servant.

   ^28And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

   ^29And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he
   died.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
   Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

   ^2The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
   Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

   ^3And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

   ^4And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

   ^5By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every
   one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

   ^6And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

   ^7And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and
   Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

   ^8And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

   ^9He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as
   Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.

   ^10And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad,
   and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

   ^11Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
   city Rehoboth, and Calah,

   ^12And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

   ^13And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

   ^14And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
   Caphtorim.

   ^15And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

   ^16And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

   ^17And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

   ^18And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward
   were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

   ^19And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to
   Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah,
   and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

   ^20These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
   tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

   ^21Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother
   of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

   ^22The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and
   Aram.

   ^23And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

   ^24And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

   ^25And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in
   his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

   ^26And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

   ^27And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

   ^28And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

   ^29And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
   Joktan.

   ^30And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount
   of the east.

   ^31These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
   tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

   ^32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
   in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth
   after the flood.

    Chapter 11

   And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

   ^2And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found
   a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

   ^3And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them
   throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

   ^4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top
   may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered
   abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

   ^5And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the
   children of men builded.

   ^6And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one
   language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained
   from them, which they have imagined to do.

   ^7Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they
   may not understand one another's speech.

   ^8So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all
   the earth: and they left off to build the city.

   ^9Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there
   confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord
   scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

   ^10These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old,
   and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

   ^11And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat
   sons and daughters.

   ^12And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

   ^13And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
   years, and begat sons and daughters.

   ^14And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

   ^15And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^16And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

   ^17And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^18And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

   ^19And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and
   begat sons and daughters.

   ^20And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

   ^21And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and
   begat sons and daughters.

   ^22And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

   ^23And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat
   sons and daughters.

   ^24And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

   ^25And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^26And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

   ^27Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor,
   and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

   ^28And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity,
   in Ur of the Chaldees.

   ^29And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was
   Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the
   father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

   ^30But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

   ^31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's
   son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went
   forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan;
   and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

   ^32And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
   died in Haran.

    Chapter 12

   Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from
   thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew
   thee:

   ^2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and
   make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

   ^3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
   thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

   ^4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with
   him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of
   Haran.

   ^5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all
   their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
   gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and
   into the land of Canaan they came.

   ^6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the
   plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

   ^7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give
   this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared
   unto him.

   ^8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and
   pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and
   there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of
   the Lord.

   ^9And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

   ^10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt
   to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

   ^11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that
   he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair
   woman to look upon:

   ^12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee,
   that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they
   will save thee alive.

   ^13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me
   for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

   ^14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
   Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

   ^15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
   Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

   ^16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
   oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,
   and camels.

   ^17And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
   because of Sarai Abram's wife.

   ^18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done
   unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

   ^19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me
   to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

   ^20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
   away, and his wife, and all that he had.

    Chapter 13

   And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had,
   and Lot with him, into the south.

   ^2And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

   ^3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the
   place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

   ^4Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first:
   and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.

   ^5And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
   tents.

   ^6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
   together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
   together.

   ^7And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the
   herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled
   then in the land.

   ^8And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between
   me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
   brethren.

   ^9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
   from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;
   or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

   ^10And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that
   it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
   Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as
   thou comest unto Zoar.

   ^11Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east:
   and they separated themselves the one from the other.

   ^12Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities
   of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

   ^13But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord
   exceedingly.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him,
   Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
   northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

   ^15For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to
   thy seed for ever.

   ^16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man
   can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.

   ^17Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
   of it; for I will give it unto thee.

   ^18Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
   Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.

    Chapter 14

   And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king
   of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;

   ^2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of
   Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the
   king of Bela, which is Zoar.

   ^3All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the
   salt sea.

   ^4Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
   they rebelled.

   ^5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were
   with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims
   in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

   ^6And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the
   wilderness.

   ^7And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote
   all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in
   Hazezontamar.

   ^8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and
   the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the
   same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;

   ^9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations,
   and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings
   with five.

   ^10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom
   and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the
   mountain.

   ^11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
   victuals, and went their way.

   ^12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and
   his goods, and departed.

   ^13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for
   he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and
   brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.

   ^14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed
   his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and
   eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

   ^15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night,
   and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand
   of Damascus.

   ^16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
   brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

   ^17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the
   slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the
   valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

   ^18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
   was the priest of the most high God.

   ^19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
   possessor of heaven and earth:

   ^20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies
   into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

   ^21And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take
   the goods to thyself.

   ^22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto
   the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

   ^23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I
   will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have
   made Abram rich:

   ^24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of
   the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take
   their portion.

    Chapter 15

   After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision,
   saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
   reward.

   ^2And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
   childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?

   ^3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one
   born in my house is mine heir.

   ^4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall
   not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels
   shall be thine heir.

   ^5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven,
   and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto
   him, So shall thy seed be.

   ^6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for
   righteousness.

   ^7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of
   the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

   ^8And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

   ^9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she
   goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a
   turtledove, and a young pigeon.

   ^10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and
   laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

   ^11And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
   away.

   ^12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and,
   lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

   ^13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
   stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they
   shall afflict them four hundred years;

   ^14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
   afterward shall they come out with great substance.

   ^15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a
   good old age.

   ^16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the
   iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

   ^17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark,
   behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those
   pieces.

   ^18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto
   thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great
   river, the river Euphrates:

   ^19The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

   ^20And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

   ^21And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the
   Jebusites.

    Chapter 16

   Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid,
   an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

   ^2And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me
   from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
   obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

   ^3And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram
   had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband
   Abram to be his wife.

   ^4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that
   she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

   ^5And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
   maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was
   despised in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.

   ^6But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her
   as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled
   from her face.

   ^7And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the
   wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

   ^8And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither
   wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

   ^9And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and
   submit thyself under her hands.

   ^10And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed
   exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

   ^11And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with
   child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because
   the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

   ^12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and
   every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all
   his brethren.

   ^13And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God
   seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth
   me?

   ^14Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between
   Kadesh and Bered.

   ^15And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which
   Hagar bare, Ishmael.

   ^16And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael
   to Abram.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 17

   And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to
   Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be
   thou perfect.

   ^2And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply
   thee exceedingly.

   ^3And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

   ^4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a
   father of many nations.

   ^5Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall
   be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

   ^6And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of
   thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

   ^7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
   after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
   God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

   ^8And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
   wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
   possession; and I will be their God.

   ^9And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
   thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

   ^10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy
   seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

   ^11And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be
   a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

   ^12And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every
   man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought
   with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

   ^13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money,
   must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for
   an everlasting covenant.

   ^14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not
   circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken
   my covenant.

   ^15And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
   call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

   ^16And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will
   bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall
   be of her.

   ^17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,
   Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall
   Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

   ^18And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

   ^19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou
   shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him
   for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

   ^20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him,
   and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve
   princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

   ^21But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear
   unto thee at this set time in the next year.

   ^22And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

   ^23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
   house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the
   men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in
   the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

   ^24And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised
   in the flesh of his foreskin.

   ^25And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised
   in the flesh of his foreskin.

   ^26In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

   ^27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
   money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 18

   And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in
   the tent door in the heat of the day;

   ^2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him:
   and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed
   himself toward the ground,

   ^3And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not
   away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

   ^4Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and
   rest yourselves under the tree:

   ^5And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after
   that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And
   they said, So do, as thou hast said.

   ^6And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
   quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the
   hearth.

   ^7And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and
   gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

   ^8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and
   set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did
   eat.

   ^9And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,
   in the tent.

   ^10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time
   of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it
   in the tent door, which was behind him.

   ^11Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
   ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

   ^12Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old
   shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

   ^13And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
   Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

   ^14Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will
   return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a
   son.

   ^15Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he
   said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

   ^16And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
   Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

   ^17And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

   ^18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation,
   and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

   ^19For I know him, that he will command his children and his household
   after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and
   judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath
   spoken of him.

   ^20And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
   and because their sin is very grievous;

   ^21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
   according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will
   know.

   ^22And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom:
   but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

   ^23And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
   righteous with the wicked?

   ^24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou
   also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are
   therein?

   ^25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
   with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that
   be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

   ^26And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the
   city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

   ^27And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to
   speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:

   ^28Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou
   destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there
   forty and five, I will not destroy it.

   ^29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall
   be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.

   ^30And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will
   speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I
   will not do it, if I find thirty there.

   ^31And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
   Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I
   will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

   ^32And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but
   this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will
   not destroy it for ten's sake.

   ^33And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
   Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

    Chapter 19

   And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of
   Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself
   with his face toward the ground;

   ^2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
   servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall
   rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will
   abide in the street all night.

   ^3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
   entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake
   unleavened bread, and they did eat.

   ^4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
   compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from
   every quarter:

   ^5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which
   came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know
   them.

   ^6And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

   ^7And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

   ^8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
   pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
   eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the
   shadow of my roof.

   ^9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came
   in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse
   with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even
   Lot, and came near to break the door.

   ^10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to
   them, and shut to the door.

   ^11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
   blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to
   find the door.

   ^12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law,
   and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,
   bring them out of this place:

   ^13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen
   great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy
   it.

   ^14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his
   daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will
   destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in
   law.

   ^15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
   Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou
   be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

   ^16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
   hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord
   being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him
   without the city.

   ^17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that
   he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou
   in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

   ^18And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:

   ^19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
   magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life;
   and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

   ^20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:
   Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall
   live.

   ^21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
   thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou
   hast spoken.

   ^22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be
   come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

   ^23The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

   ^24Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
   from the Lord out of heaven;

   ^25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
   inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

   ^26But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of
   salt.

   ^27And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood
   before the Lord:

   ^28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of
   the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the
   smoke of a furnace.

   ^29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
   that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the
   overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

   ^30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two
   daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a
   cave, he and his two daughters.

   ^31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and
   there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of
   all the earth:

   ^32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
   that we may preserve seed of our father.

   ^33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn
   went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay
   down, nor when she arose.

   ^34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the
   younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him
   drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we
   may preserve seed of our father.

   ^35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
   younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay
   down, nor when she arose.

   ^36Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

   ^37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is
   the father of the Moabites unto this day.

   ^38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi:
   the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

    Chapter 20

   And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled
   between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

   ^2And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech
   king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

   ^3But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
   Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;
   for she is a man's wife.

   ^4But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou
   slay also a righteous nation?

   ^5Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself
   said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of
   my hands have I done this.

   ^6And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in
   the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning
   against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

   ^7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he
   shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not,
   know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.

   ^8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
   servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were
   sore afraid.

   ^9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done
   unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me
   and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought
   not to be done.

   ^10And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast
   done this thing?

   ^11And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not
   in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

   ^12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father,
   but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

   ^13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's
   house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew
   unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my
   brother.

   ^14And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
   womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his
   wife.

   ^15And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it
   pleaseth thee.

   ^16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
   pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto
   all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.

   ^17So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife,
   and his maidservants; and they bare children.

   ^18For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
   Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

    Chapter 21

   And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah
   as he had spoken.

   ^2For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the
   set time of which God had spoken to him.

   ^3And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom
   Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

   ^4And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God
   had commanded him.

   ^5And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
   unto him.

   ^6And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will
   laugh with me.

   ^7And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
   have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.

   ^8And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast
   the same day that Isaac was weaned.

   ^9And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto
   Abraham, mocking.

   ^10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
   son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even
   with Isaac.

   ^11And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his
   son.

   ^12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
   because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah
   hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy
   seed be called.

   ^13And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because
   he is thy seed.

   ^14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
   bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,
   and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the
   wilderness of Beersheba.

   ^15And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under
   one of the shrubs.

   ^16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as
   it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child.
   And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.

   ^17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to
   Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear
   not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.

   ^18Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make
   him a great nation.

   ^19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went,
   and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

   ^20And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
   and became an archer.

   ^21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a
   wife out of the land of Egypt.

   ^22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
   chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee
   in all that thou doest:

   ^23Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal
   falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according
   to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and
   to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

   ^24And Abraham said, I will swear.

   ^25And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
   Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

   ^26And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither
   didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

   ^27And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and
   both of them made a covenant.

   ^28And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

   ^29And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
   which thou hast set by themselves?

   ^30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
   that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

   ^31Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware
   both of them.

   ^32Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and
   Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land
   of the Philistines.

   ^33And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the
   name of the Lord, the everlasting God.

   ^34And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 22

   And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and
   said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.

   ^2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
   lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a
   burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

   ^3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
   took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the
   wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of
   which God had told him.

   ^4Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place
   afar off.

   ^5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and
   I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

   ^6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
   Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they
   went both of them together.

   ^7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he
   said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but
   where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

   ^8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
   offering: so they went both of them together.

   ^9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
   built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
   son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

   ^10And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his
   son.

   ^11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said,
   Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

   ^12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any
   thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast
   not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

   ^13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a
   ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the
   ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.

   ^14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is
   said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.

   ^15And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the
   second time,

   ^16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou
   hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:

   ^17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
   multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is
   upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;

   ^18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
   because thou hast obeyed my voice.

   ^19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went
   together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

   ^20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham,
   saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother
   Nahor;

   ^21Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of
   Aram,

   ^22And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

   ^23And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
   Abraham's brother.

   ^24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and
   Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

    Chapter 23

   And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the
   years of the life of Sarah.

   ^2And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
   Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

   ^3And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of
   Heth, saying,

   ^4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a
   buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

   ^5And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

   ^6Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of
   our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his
   sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

   ^7And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
   even to the children of Heth.

   ^8And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should
   bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the
   son of Zohar,

   ^9That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in
   the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it
   me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.

   ^10And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite
   answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all
   that went in at the gate of his city, saying,

   ^11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is
   therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give
   I it thee: bury thy dead.

   ^12And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

   ^13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land,
   saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give
   thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

   ^14And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

   ^15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of
   silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

   ^16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the
   silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four
   hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

   ^17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before
   Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees
   that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were
   made sure

   ^18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of
   Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

   ^19And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
   field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of
   Canaan.

   ^20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
   Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 24

   And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed
   Abraham in all things.

   ^2And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
   over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:

   ^3And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the
   God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
   daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

   ^4But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife
   unto my son Isaac.

   ^5And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
   willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again
   unto the land from whence thou camest?

   ^6And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son
   thither again.

   ^7The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and
   from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware
   unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his
   angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

   ^8And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt
   be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.

   ^9And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,
   and sware to him concerning that matter.

   ^10And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
   departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he
   arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

   ^11And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of
   water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to
   draw water.

   ^12And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me
   good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

   ^13Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the
   men of the city come out to draw water:

   ^14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let
   down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,
   Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that
   thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know
   that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.

   ^15And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
   Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of
   Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

   ^16And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any
   man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher,
   and came up.

   ^17And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
   drink a little water of thy pitcher.

   ^18And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
   pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

   ^19And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water
   for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

   ^20And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
   again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

   ^21And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord
   had made his journey prosperous or not.

   ^22And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man
   took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for
   her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

   ^23And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there
   room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

   ^24And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
   Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

   ^25She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough,
   and room to lodge in.

   ^26And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord.

   ^27And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath
   not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the
   way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren.

   ^28And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
   things.

   ^29And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out
   unto the man, unto the well.

   ^30And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his
   sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,
   saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,
   behold, he stood by the camels at the well.

   ^31And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest
   thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

   ^32And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and
   gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,
   and the men's feet that were with him.

   ^33And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not
   eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

   ^34And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

   ^35And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great:
   and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and
   menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.

   ^36And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old:
   and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

   ^37And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to
   my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:

   ^38But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and
   take a wife unto my son.

   ^39And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow
   me.

   ^40And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I walk, will send his
   angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my
   son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

   ^41Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my
   kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my
   oath.

   ^42And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of my master
   Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

   ^43Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass,
   that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give
   me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;

   ^44And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy
   camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for
   my master's son.

   ^45And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came
   forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the
   well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.

   ^46And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and
   said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she
   made the camels drink also.

   ^47And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said,
   The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I
   put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

   ^48And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the
   Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to
   take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

   ^49And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me:
   and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

   ^50Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from
   the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

   ^51Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy
   master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken.

   ^52And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words,
   he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.

   ^53And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
   and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and
   to her mother precious things.

   ^54And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and
   tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send
   me away unto my master.

   ^55And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a
   few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

   ^56And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered
   my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

   ^57And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.

   ^58And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this
   man? And she said, I will go.

   ^59And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
   Abraham's servant, and his men.

   ^60And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be
   thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the
   gate of those which hate them.

   ^61And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels,
   and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

   ^62And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in
   the south country.

   ^63And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he
   lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.

   ^64And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted
   off the camel.

   ^65For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in
   the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:
   therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

   ^66And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

   ^67And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
   Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was
   comforted after his mother's death.

    Chapter 25

   Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

   ^2And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
   Ishbak, and Shuah.

   ^3And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
   Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

   ^4And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and
   Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

   ^5And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

   ^6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave
   gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
   eastward, unto the east country.

   ^7And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived,
   an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

   ^8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old
   man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

   ^9And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
   in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before
   Mamre;

   ^10The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was
   Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

   ^11And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his
   son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

   ^12Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar
   the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

   ^13And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
   according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and
   Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

   ^14And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

   ^15Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

   ^16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their
   towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

   ^17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
   thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was
   gathered unto his people.

   ^18And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou
   goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.

   ^19And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat
   Isaac:

   ^20And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the
   daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the
   Syrian.

   ^21And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren:
   and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

   ^22And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it
   be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord.

   ^23And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
   manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people
   shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the
   younger.

   ^24And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were
   twins in her womb.

   ^25And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they
   called his name Esau.

   ^26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
   Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore
   years old when she bare them.

   ^27And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
   field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

   ^28And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah
   loved Jacob.

   ^29And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
   faint:

   ^30And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
   pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.

   ^31And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

   ^32And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit
   shall this birthright do to me?

   ^33And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he
   sold his birthright unto Jacob.

   ^34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat
   and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his
   birthright.

    Chapter 26

   And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in
   the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
   Philistines unto Gerar.

   ^2And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
   dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

   ^3Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee;
   for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and
   I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;

   ^4And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will
   give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the
   nations of the earth be blessed;

   ^5Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
   commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

   ^6And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

   ^7And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is
   my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men
   of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look
   upon.

   ^8And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
   Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and,
   behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

   ^9And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy
   wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him,
   Because I said, Lest I die for her.

   ^10And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the
   people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have
   brought guiltiness upon us.

   ^11And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this
   man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

   ^12Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
   hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.

   ^13And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became
   very great:

   ^14For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great
   store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

   ^15For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days
   of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled
   them with earth.

   ^16And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
   mightier than we.

   ^17And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of
   Gerar, and dwelt there.

   ^18And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in
   the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them
   after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names
   by which his father had called them.

   ^19And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of
   springing water.

   ^20And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying,
   The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because
   they strove with him.

   ^21And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
   called the name of it Sitnah.

   ^22And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that
   they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said,
   For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the
   land.

   ^23And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

   ^24And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the
   God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless
   thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

   ^25And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord,
   and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.

   ^26Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
   friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

   ^27And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate
   me, and have sent me away from you?

   ^28And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we
   said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee,
   and let us make a covenant with thee;

   ^29That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we
   have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace:
   thou art now the blessed of the Lord.

   ^30And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

   ^31And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another:
   and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

   ^32And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and
   told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him,
   We have found water.

   ^33And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba
   unto this day.

   ^34And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
   daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
   Hittite:

   ^35Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 27

   And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so
   that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto
   him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.

   ^2And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:

   ^3Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow,
   and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

   ^4And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I
   may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

   ^5And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to
   the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

   ^6And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
   father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

   ^7Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless
   thee before the Lord before my death.

   ^8Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
   command thee.

   ^9Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the
   goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he
   loveth:

   ^10And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he
   may bless thee before his death.

   ^11And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a
   hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

   ^12My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a
   deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

   ^13And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
   obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

   ^14And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his
   mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

   ^15And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were
   with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:

   ^16And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and
   upon the smooth of his neck:

   ^17And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared,
   into the hand of her son Jacob.

   ^18And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
   am I; who art thou, my son?

   ^19And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done
   according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my
   venison, that thy soul may bless me.

   ^20And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so
   quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it to
   me.

   ^21And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel
   thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

   ^22And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and
   said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

   ^23And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
   brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

   ^24And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

   ^25And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
   venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,
   and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.

   ^26And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my
   son.

   ^27And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his
   raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the
   smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed:

   ^28Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the
   earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

   ^29Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over
   thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be
   every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

   ^30And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing
   Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his
   father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

   ^31And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father,
   and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's
   venison, that thy soul may bless me.

   ^32And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am
   thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

   ^33And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that
   hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before
   thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.

   ^34And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great
   and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me
   also, O my father.

   ^35And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy
   blessing.

   ^36And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted
   me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he
   hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a
   blessing for me?

   ^37And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy
   lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with
   corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee,
   my son?

   ^38And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
   father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his
   voice, and wept.

   ^39And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
   dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven
   from above;

   ^40And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and
   it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou
   shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

   ^41And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father
   blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my
   father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

   ^42And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she
   sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy
   brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill
   thee.

   ^43Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban
   my brother to Haran;

   ^44And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;

   ^45Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that
   which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from
   thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

   ^46And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the
   daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such
   as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my
   life do me?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 28

   And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto
   him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

   ^2Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father;
   and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's
   brother.

   ^3And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
   thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

   ^4And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with
   thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger,
   which God gave unto Abraham.

   ^5And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son
   of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's
   mother.

   ^6When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to
   Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him
   he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the
   daughters of Canaan;

   ^7And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to
   Padanaram;

   ^8And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his
   father;

   ^9Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had
   Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth,
   to be his wife.

   ^10And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

   ^11And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night,
   because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and
   put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.

   ^12And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top
   of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and
   descending on it.

   ^13And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of
   Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest,
   to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

   ^14And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
   spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to
   the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the
   earth be blessed.

   ^15And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
   whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I
   will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee
   of.

   ^16And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is
   in this place; and I knew it not.

   ^17And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is
   none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

   ^18And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he
   had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil
   upon the top of it.

   ^19And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that
   city was called Luz at the first.

   ^20And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep
   me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to
   put on,

   ^21So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the
   Lord be my God:

   ^22And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house:
   and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto
   thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 29

   Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of
   the east.

   ^2And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were
   three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered
   the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.

   ^3And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone
   from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again
   upon the well's mouth in his place.

   ^4And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said,
   Of Haran are we.

   ^5And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said,
   We know him.

   ^6And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and,
   behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

   ^7And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
   cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed
   them.

   ^8And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together,
   and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the
   sheep.

   ^9And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's
   sheep: for she kept them.

   ^10And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his
   mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that
   Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and
   watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

   ^11And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

   ^12And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he
   was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

   ^13And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
   sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed
   him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

   ^14And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he
   abode with him the space of a month.

   ^15And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest
   thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?

   ^16And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the
   name of the younger was Rachel.

   ^17Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.

   ^18And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for
   Rachel thy younger daughter.

   ^19And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I
   should give her to another man: abide with me.

   ^20And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
   but a few days, for the love he had to her.

   ^21And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
   fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

   ^22And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a
   feast.

   ^23And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,
   and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

   ^24And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
   handmaid.

   ^25And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and
   he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve
   with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

   ^26And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the
   younger before the firstborn.

   ^27Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
   which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

   ^28And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his
   daughter to wife also.

   ^29And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her
   maid.

   ^30And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than
   Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

   ^31And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but
   Rachel was barren.

   ^32And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben:
   for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now
   therefore my husband will love me.

   ^33And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the Lord
   hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:
   and she called his name Simeon.

   ^34And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time
   will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:
   therefore was his name called Levi.

   ^35And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I
   praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 30

   And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her
   sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.

   ^2And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in
   God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

   ^3And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall
   bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her.

   ^4And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto
   her.

   ^5And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

   ^6And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice,
   and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.

   ^7And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second
   son.

   ^8And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
   sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.

   ^9When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid,
   and gave her Jacob to wife.

   ^10And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

   ^11And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

   ^12And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

   ^13And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed:
   and she called his name Asher.

   ^14And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in
   the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to
   Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

   ^15And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my
   husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And
   Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's
   mandrakes.

   ^16And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to
   meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired
   thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

   ^17And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the
   fifth son.

   ^18And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my
   maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

   ^19And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

   ^20And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my
   husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called
   his name Zebulun.

   ^21And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

   ^22And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her
   womb.

   ^23And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my
   reproach:

   ^24And she called his name Joseph; and said, The Lord shall add to me
   another son.

   ^25And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said
   unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my
   country.

   ^26Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and
   let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

   ^27And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in
   thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath
   blessed me for thy sake.

   ^28And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

   ^29And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how
   thy cattle was with me.

   ^30For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now
   increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my
   coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

   ^31And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not
   give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed
   and keep thy flock:

   ^32I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all
   the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the
   sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall
   be my hire.

   ^33So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it
   shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled
   and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be
   counted stolen with me.

   ^34And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.

   ^35And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
   spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and
   every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep,
   and gave them into the hand of his sons.

   ^36And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob
   fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

   ^37And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
   chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white
   appear which was in the rods.

   ^38And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
   gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that
   they should conceive when they came to drink.

   ^39And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle
   ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

   ^40And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks
   toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he
   put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.

   ^41And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive,
   that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters,
   that they might conceive among the rods.

   ^42But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler
   were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

   ^43And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
   maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

    Chapter 31

   And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away
   all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he
   gotten all this glory.

   ^2And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not
   toward him as before.

   ^3And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers,
   and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

   ^4And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
   flock,

   ^5And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not
   toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.

   ^6And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

   ^7And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but
   God suffered him not to hurt me.

   ^8If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle
   bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire;
   then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

   ^9Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to
   me.

   ^10And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I
   lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which
   leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.

   ^11And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I
   said, Here am I.

   ^12And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which
   leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have
   seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

   ^13I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where
   thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and
   return unto the land of thy kindred.

   ^14And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
   portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

   ^15Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath
   quite devoured also our money.

   ^16For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is
   ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee,
   do.

   ^17Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

   ^18And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had
   gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram,
   for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

   ^19And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images
   that were her father's.

   ^20And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told
   him not that he fled.

   ^21So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the
   river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

   ^22And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

   ^23And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days'
   journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

   ^24And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto
   him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

   ^25Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
   mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

   ^26And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen
   away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken
   with the sword?

   ^27Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and
   didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and
   with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

   ^28And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast
   now done foolishly in so doing.

   ^29It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your
   father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou
   speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

   ^30And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
   longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
   gods?

   ^31And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I
   said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.

   ^32With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our
   brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For
   Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

   ^33And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the
   two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of
   Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

   ^34Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
   furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but
   found them not.

   ^35And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
   cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he
   searched, but found not the images.

   ^36And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and
   said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so
   hotly pursued after me?

   ^37Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all
   thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren,
   that they may judge betwixt us both.

   ^38This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats
   have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

   ^39That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the
   loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or
   stolen by night.

   ^40Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
   night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

   ^41Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen
   years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou
   hast changed my wages ten times.

   ^42Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
   Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God
   hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee
   yesternight.

   ^43And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
   daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my
   cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day
   unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?

   ^44Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let
   it be for a witness between me and thee.

   ^45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

   ^46And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
   stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.

   ^47And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.

   ^48And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.
   Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

   ^49And Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and thee, when we
   are absent one from another.

   ^50If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
   wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness
   betwixt me and thee.

   ^51And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar,
   which I have cast betwixt me and thee;

   ^52This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not
   pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this
   heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

   ^53The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father,
   judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

   ^54Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren
   to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the
   mount.

   ^55And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his
   daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his
   place.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 32

   And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

   ^2And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called
   the name of that place Mahanaim.

   ^3And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
   land of Seir, the country of Edom.

   ^4And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau;
   Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed
   there until now:

   ^5And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
   womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace
   in thy sight.

   ^6And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother
   Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

   ^7Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
   people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,
   into two bands;

   ^8And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the
   other company which is left shall escape.

   ^9And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
   Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to
   thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

   ^10I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the
   truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I
   passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

   ^11Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand
   of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother
   with the children.

   ^12And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as
   the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

   ^13And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to
   his hand a present for Esau his brother;

   ^14Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and
   twenty rams,

   ^15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,
   twenty she asses, and ten foals.

   ^16And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by
   themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a
   space betwixt drove and drove.

   ^17And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth
   thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou?
   and whose are these before thee?

   ^18Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present
   sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.

   ^19And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed
   the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye
   find him.

   ^20And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he
   said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and
   afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

   ^21So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night
   in the company.

   ^22And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
   womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

   ^23And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that
   he had.

   ^24And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until
   the breaking of the day.

   ^25And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the
   hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint,
   as he wrestled with him.

   ^26And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will
   not let thee go, except thou bless me.

   ^27And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

   ^28And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for
   as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

   ^29And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And
   he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he
   blessed him there.

   ^30And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God
   face to face, and my life is preserved.

   ^31And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted
   upon his thigh.

   ^32Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank,
   which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he
   touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 33

   And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and
   with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and
   unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

   ^2And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and
   her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

   ^3And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven
   times, until he came near to his brother.

   ^4And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
   kissed him: and they wept.

   ^5And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and
   said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath
   graciously given thy servant.

   ^6Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they
   bowed themselves.

   ^7And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and
   after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

   ^8And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he
   said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

   ^9And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto
   thyself.

   ^10And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy
   sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen
   thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased
   with me.

   ^11Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God
   hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged
   him, and he took it.

   ^12And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go
   before thee.

   ^13And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender,
   and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should
   overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

   ^14Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will
   lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the
   children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

   ^15And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are
   with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight
   of my lord.

   ^16So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

   ^17And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made
   booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called
   Succoth.

   ^18And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of
   Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the
   city.

   ^19And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at
   the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred
   pieces of money.

   ^20And he erected there an altar, and called it Elelohe-Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 34

   And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to
   see the daughters of the land.

   ^2And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country,
   saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

   ^3And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the
   damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

   ^4And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel
   to wife.

   ^5And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons
   were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they
   were come.

   ^6And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with
   him.

   ^7And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and
   the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought
   folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not
   to be done.

   ^8And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
   longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.

   ^9And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and
   take our daughters unto you.

   ^10And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell
   and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

   ^11And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find
   grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.

   ^12Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye
   shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

   ^13And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
   deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:

   ^14And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister
   to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:

   ^15But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that
   every male of you be circumcised;

   ^16Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your
   daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one
   people.

   ^17But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we
   take our daughter, and we will be gone.

   ^18And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

   ^19And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
   delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the
   house of his father.

   ^20And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and
   communed with the men of their city, saying,

   ^21These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the
   land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for
   them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them
   our daughters.

   ^22Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be
   one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are
   circumcised.

   ^23Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs
   be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.

   ^24And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out
   of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went
   out of the gate of his city.

   ^25And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two
   of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man
   his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.

   ^26And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword,
   and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

   ^27The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because
   they had defiled their sister.

   ^28They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that
   which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

   ^29And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives
   took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.

   ^30And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to
   stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the
   Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves
   together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my
   house.

   ^31And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 35

   And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and
   make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou
   fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

   ^2Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him,
   Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change
   your garments:

   ^3And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar
   unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in
   the way which I went.

   ^4And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
   hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid
   them under the oak which was by Shechem.

   ^5And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that
   were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

   ^6So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
   Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

   ^7And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because
   there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

   ^8But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel
   under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.

   ^9And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and
   blessed him.

   ^10And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
   called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his
   name Israel.

   ^11And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply;
   a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall
   come out of thy loins;

   ^12And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it,
   and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

   ^13And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

   ^14And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
   even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he
   poured oil thereon.

   ^15And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,
   Bethel.

   ^16And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to
   come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

   ^17And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife
   said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

   ^18And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died)
   that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.

   ^19And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is
   Bethlehem.

   ^20And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
   Rachel's grave unto this day.

   ^21And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

   ^22And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben
   went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.
   Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

   ^23The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi,
   and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

   ^24The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

   ^25And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

   ^26And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are
   the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

   ^27And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of
   Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

   ^28And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

   ^29And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his
   people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried
   him.

    Chapter 36

   Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

   ^2Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of
   Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of
   Zibeon the Hivite;

   ^3And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

   ^4And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

   ^5And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons
   of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

   ^6And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the
   persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his
   substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the
   country from the face of his brother Jacob.

   ^7For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and
   the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of
   their cattle.

   ^8Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

   ^9And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in
   mount Seir:

   ^10These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife
   of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

   ^11And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
   Kenaz.

   ^12And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
   Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

   ^13And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and
   Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

   ^14And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the
   daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and
   Jaalam, and Korah.

   ^15These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
   firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

   ^16Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that
   came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.

   ^17And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah,
   duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in
   the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

   ^18And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke
   Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the
   daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

   ^19These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.

   ^20These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
   Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

   ^21And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
   Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

   ^22And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister
   was Timna.

   ^23And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and
   Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

   ^24And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was
   that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses
   of Zibeon his father.

   ^25And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the
   daughter of Anah.

   ^26And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
   Ithran, and Cheran.

   ^27The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

   ^28The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

   ^29These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
   Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

   ^30Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came
   of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

   ^31And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before
   there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

   ^32And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city
   was Dinhabah.

   ^33And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his
   stead.

   ^34And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his
   stead.

   ^35And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the
   field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was
   Avith.

   ^36And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

   ^37And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his
   stead.

   ^38And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.

   ^39And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
   stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was
   Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

   ^40And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to
   their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke
   Alvah, duke Jetheth,

   ^41Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

   ^42Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

   ^43Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to
   their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the
   father of the Edomites.

    Chapter 37

   And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the
   land of Canaan.

   ^2These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
   old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the
   sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and
   Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.

   ^3Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was
   the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.

   ^4And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all
   his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.

   ^5And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they
   hated him yet the more.

   ^6And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
   dreamed:

   ^7For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf
   arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round
   about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

   ^8And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
   shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the
   more for his dreams, and for his words.

   ^9And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
   Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon
   and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.

   ^10And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father
   rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast
   dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow
   down ourselves to thee to the earth?

   ^11And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

   ^12And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

   ^13And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
   Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here
   am I.

   ^14And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy
   brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent
   him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

   ^15And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the
   field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

   ^16And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they
   feed their flocks.

   ^17And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let
   us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in
   Dothan.

   ^18And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them,
   they conspired against him to slay him.

   ^19And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

   ^20Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit,
   and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see
   what will become of his dreams.

   ^21And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and
   said, Let us not kill him.

   ^22And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit
   that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid
   him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.

   ^23And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that
   they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was
   on him;

   ^24And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty,
   there was no water in it.

   ^25And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and
   looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with
   their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down
   to Egypt.

   ^26And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our
   brother, and conceal his blood?

   ^27Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand
   be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were
   content.

   ^28Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
   lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for
   twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

   ^29And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the
   pit; and he rent his clothes.

   ^30And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and
   I, whither shall I go?

   ^31And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and
   dipped the coat in the blood;

   ^32And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their
   father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's
   coat or no.

   ^33And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath
   devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

   ^34And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and
   mourned for his son many days.

   ^35And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but
   he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the
   grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

   ^36And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
   Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

    Chapter 38

   And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
   brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

   ^2And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was
   Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

   ^3And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

   ^4And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
   Onan.

   ^5And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
   Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

   ^6And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.

   ^7And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and
   the Lord slew him.

   ^8And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry
   her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

   ^9And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass,
   when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the
   ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

   ^10And the thing which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew
   him also.

   ^11Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy
   father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest
   peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt
   in her father's house.

   ^12And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and
   Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he
   and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

   ^13And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to
   Timnath to shear his sheep.

   ^14And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with
   a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the
   way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not
   given unto him to wife.

   ^15When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had
   covered her face.

   ^16And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let
   me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in
   law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in
   unto me?

   ^17And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said,
   Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

   ^18And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
   signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he
   gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

   ^19And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put
   on the garments of her widowhood.

   ^20And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to
   receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.

   ^21Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot,
   that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in
   this place.

   ^22And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the
   men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.

   ^23And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I
   sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

   ^24And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
   Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and
   also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her
   forth, and let her be burnt.

   ^25When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying,
   By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I
   pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

   ^26And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous
   than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her
   again no more.

   ^27And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins
   were in her womb.

   ^28And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his
   hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread,
   saying, This came out first.

   ^29And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
   brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach
   be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

   ^30And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon
   his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

    Chapter 39

   And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
   Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
   the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

   ^2And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was
   in the house of his master the Egyptian.

   ^3And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made
   all that he did to prosper in his hand.

   ^4And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made
   him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

   ^5And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in
   his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the
   Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was
   upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.

   ^6And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought
   he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly
   person, and well favoured.

   ^7And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast
   her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

   ^8But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master
   wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all
   that he hath to my hand;

   ^9There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back
   any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I
   do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

   ^10And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he
   hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

   ^11And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house
   to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there
   within.

   ^12And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left
   his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

   ^13And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in
   her hand, and was fled forth,

   ^14That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them,
   saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came
   in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:

   ^15And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and
   cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.

   ^16And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

   ^17And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew
   servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:

   ^18And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
   his garment with me, and fled out.

   ^19And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife,
   which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to
   me; that his wrath was kindled.

   ^20And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place
   where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.

   ^21But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
   favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

   ^22And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the
   prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he
   was the doer of it.

   ^23The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his
   hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord
   made it to prosper.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 40

   And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of
   Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.

   ^2And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief
   of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

   ^3And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
   into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

   ^4And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served
   them: and they continued a season in ward.

   ^5And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
   night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the
   butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the
   prison.

   ^6And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them,
   and, behold, they were sad.

   ^7And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his
   lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?

   ^8And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
   interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
   belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

   ^9And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my
   dream, behold, a vine was before me;

   ^10And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded,
   and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth
   ripe grapes:

   ^11And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed
   them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

   ^12And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
   three branches are three days:

   ^13Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore
   thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his
   hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

   ^14But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness,
   I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me
   out of this house:

   ^15For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and
   here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

   ^16When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said
   unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white
   baskets on my head:

   ^17And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for
   Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.

   ^18And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof:
   The three baskets are three days:

   ^19Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee,
   and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from
   off thee.

   ^20And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,
   that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head
   of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

   ^21And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he
   gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

   ^22But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

   ^23Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 41

   And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
   and, behold, he stood by the river.

   ^2And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine
   and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

   ^3And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river,
   ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the
   brink of the river.

   ^4And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
   favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

   ^5And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of
   corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

   ^6And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
   after them.

   ^7And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And
   Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

   ^8And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and
   he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
   thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
   interpret them unto Pharaoh.

   ^9Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
   faults this day:

   ^10Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
   captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

   ^11And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man
   according to the interpretation of his dream.

   ^12And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the
   captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our
   dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

   ^13And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
   restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

   ^14Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily
   out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and
   came in unto Pharaoh.

   ^15And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is
   none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou
   canst understand a dream to interpret it.

   ^16And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
   Pharaoh an answer of peace.

   ^17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the
   bank of the river:

   ^18And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
   and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

   ^19And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill
   favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt
   for badness:

   ^20And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven
   fat kine:

   ^21And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had
   eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I
   awoke.

   ^22And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
   full and good:

   ^23And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east
   wind, sprung up after them:

   ^24And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto
   the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.

   ^25And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath
   shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

   ^26The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
   seven years: the dream is one.

   ^27And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are
   seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall
   be seven years of famine.

   ^28This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
   about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

   ^29Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the
   land of Egypt:

   ^30And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
   plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
   consume the land;

   ^31And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that
   famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

   ^32And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because
   the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

   ^33Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set
   him over the land of Egypt.

   ^34Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and
   take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
   years.

   ^35And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and
   lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the
   cities.

   ^36And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years
   of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish
   not through the famine.

   ^37And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of
   all his servants.

   ^38And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this
   is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

   ^39And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all
   this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

   ^40Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all
   my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

   ^41And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^42And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
   Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a
   gold chain about his neck;

   ^43And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they
   cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^44And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall
   no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

   ^45And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to
   wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went
   out over all the land of Egypt.

   ^46And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
   Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went
   throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^47And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
   handfuls.

   ^48And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in
   the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the
   field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

   ^49And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he
   left numbering; for it was without number.

   ^50And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,
   which Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him.

   ^51And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
   he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

   ^52And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me
   to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

   ^53And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,
   were ended.

   ^54And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had
   said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt
   there was bread.

   ^55And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
   Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
   Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

   ^56And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened
   all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed
   sore in the land of Egypt.

   ^57And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
   that the famine was so sore in all lands.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 42

   Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his
   sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

   ^2And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get
   you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not
   die.

   ^3And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

   ^4But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for
   he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

   ^5And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for
   the famine was in the land of Canaan.

   ^6And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to
   all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down
   themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

   ^7And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
   strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,
   Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

   ^8And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

   ^9And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said
   unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

   ^10And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
   servants come.

   ^11We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
   spies.

   ^12And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye
   are come.

   ^13And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man
   in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our
   father, and one is not.

   ^14And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying,
   Ye are spies:

   ^15Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
   forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

   ^16Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
   kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any
   truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

   ^17And he put them all together into ward three days.

   ^18And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I
   fear God:

   ^19If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of
   your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

   ^20But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be
   verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

   ^21And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
   brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us,
   and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

   ^22And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do
   not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold,
   also his blood is required.

   ^23And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
   them by an interpreter.

   ^24And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to
   them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and
   bound him before their eyes.

   ^25Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore
   every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the
   way: and thus did he unto them.

   ^26And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

   ^27And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the
   inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

   ^28And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is
   even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,
   saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?

   ^29And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and
   told him all that befell unto them; saying,

   ^30The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took
   us for spies of the country.

   ^31And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

   ^32We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
   youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

   ^33And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I
   know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and
   take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:

   ^34And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye
   are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your
   brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

   ^35And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every
   man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their
   father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

   ^36And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
   children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin
   away: all these things are against me.

   ^37And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
   bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him
   to thee again.

   ^38And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is
   dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the
   which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the
   grave.

    Chapter 43

   And the famine was sore in the land.

   ^2And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had
   brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a
   little food.

   ^3And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto
   us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

   ^4If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee
   food:

   ^5But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said
   unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

   ^6And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the
   man whether ye had yet a brother?

   ^7And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our
   kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and
   we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly
   know that he would say, Bring your brother down?

   ^8And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we
   will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,
   and also our little ones.

   ^9I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
   bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the
   blame for ever:

   ^10For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second
   time.

   ^11And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
   this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry
   down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and
   myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

   ^12And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought
   again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand;
   peradventure it was an oversight:

   ^13Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

   ^14And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send
   away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children,
   I am bereaved.

   ^15And the men took that present, and they took double money in their
   hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood
   before Joseph.

   ^16And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
   house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men
   shall dine with me at noon.

   ^17And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
   Joseph's house.

   ^18And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's
   house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
   sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion
   against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

   ^19And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
   communed with him at the door of the house,

   ^20And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

   ^21And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our
   sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our
   money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.

   ^22And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we
   cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

   ^23And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
   your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.
   And he brought Simeon out unto them.

   ^24And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
   water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

   ^25And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for
   they heard that they should eat bread there.

   ^26And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in
   their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

   ^27And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well,
   the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

   ^28And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is
   yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

   ^29And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
   mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake
   unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

   ^30And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother:
   and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept
   there.

   ^31And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
   said, Set on bread.

   ^32And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
   for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the
   Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an
   abomination unto the Egyptians.

   ^33And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,
   and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at
   another.

   ^34And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
   Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they
   drank, and were merry with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 44

   And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks
   with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his
   sack's mouth.

   ^2And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest,
   and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had
   spoken.

   ^3As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and
   their asses.

   ^4And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph
   said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost
   overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

   ^5Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he
   divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

   ^6And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

   ^7And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
   forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

   ^8Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought
   again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out
   of thy lord's house silver or gold?

   ^9With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we
   also will be my lord's bondmen.

   ^10And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with
   whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

   ^11Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and
   opened every man his sack.

   ^12And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest:
   and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

   ^13Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
   returned to the city.

   ^14And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet
   there: and they fell before him on the ground.

   ^15And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot
   ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

   ^16And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?
   or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy
   servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with
   whom the cup is found.

   ^17And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose
   hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you
   up in peace unto your father.

   ^18Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
   servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine
   anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.

   ^19My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

   ^20And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child
   of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is
   left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

   ^21And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I
   may set mine eyes upon him.

   ^22And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he
   should leave his father, his father would die.

   ^23And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come
   down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

   ^24And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we
   told him the words of my lord.

   ^25And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

   ^26And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us,
   then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our
   youngest brother be with us.

   ^27And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me
   two sons:

   ^28And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
   pieces; and I saw him not since:

   ^29And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall
   bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

   ^30Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be
   not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;

   ^31It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us,
   that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of
   thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

   ^32For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If
   I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for
   ever.

   ^33Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad
   a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

   ^34For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest
   peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 45

   Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by
   him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood
   no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

   ^2And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

   ^3And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet
   live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at
   his presence.

   ^4And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And
   they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold
   into Egypt.

   ^5Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold
   me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.

   ^6For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there
   are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.

   ^7And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth,
   and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

   ^8So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made
   me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler
   throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^9Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy
   son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,
   tarry not:

   ^10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near
   unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy
   flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:

   ^11And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
   famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to
   poverty.

   ^12And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
   that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

   ^13And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
   that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

   ^14And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin
   wept upon his neck.

   ^15Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after
   that his brethren talked with him.

   ^16And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
   brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.

   ^17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
   lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

   ^18And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I
   will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
   of the land.

   ^19Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land
   of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your
   father, and come.

   ^20Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is
   yours.

   ^21And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
   according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for
   the way.

   ^22To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin
   he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

   ^23And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with
   the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread
   and meat for his father by the way.

   ^24So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto
   them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

   ^25And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto
   Jacob their father,

   ^26And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over
   all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them
   not.

   ^27And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto
   them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him,
   the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

   ^28And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go
   and see him before I die.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 46

   And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
   Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

   ^2And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
   Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

   ^3And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down
   into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

   ^4I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring
   thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

   ^5And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried
   Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the
   wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

   ^6And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in
   the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with
   him:

   ^7His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons'
   daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

   ^8And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
   Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

   ^9And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

   ^10And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
   Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

   ^11And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

   ^12And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and
   Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of
   Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

   ^13And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.

   ^14And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

   ^15These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram,
   with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters
   were thirty and three.

   ^16And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and
   Arodi, and Areli.

   ^17And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and
   Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.

   ^18These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter,
   and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

   ^19The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

   ^20And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim,
   which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

   ^21And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera,
   and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

   ^22These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the
   souls were fourteen.

   ^23And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

   ^24And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

   ^25These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
   daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.

   ^26All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his
   loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and
   six;

   ^27And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
   souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were
   threescore and ten.

   ^28And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto
   Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

   ^29And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his
   father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his
   neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

   ^30And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy
   face, because thou art yet alive.

   ^31And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I
   will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my
   father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

   ^32And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle;
   and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
   have.

   ^33And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall
   say, What is your occupation?

   ^34That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from
   our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may
   dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto
   the Egyptians.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 47

   Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren,
   and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out
   of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

   ^2And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them
   unto Pharaoh.

   ^3And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they
   said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our
   fathers.

   ^4They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
   come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine
   is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy
   servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

   ^5And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren
   are come unto thee:

   ^6The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy
   father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and
   if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers
   over my cattle.

   ^7And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh:
   and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

   ^8And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

   ^9And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage
   are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the
   years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years
   of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

   ^10And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

   ^11And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
   possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land
   of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

   ^12And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
   father's household, with bread, according to their families.

   ^13And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very
   sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by
   reason of the famine.

   ^14And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of
   Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and
   Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

   ^15And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
   Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:
   for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.

   ^16And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
   cattle, if money fail.

   ^17And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
   bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of
   the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their
   cattle for that year.

   ^18When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and
   said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is
   spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left
   in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:

   ^19Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy
   us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto
   Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land
   be not desolate.

   ^20And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
   Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over
   them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

   ^21And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the
   borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

   ^22Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a
   portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which
   Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.

   ^23Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day
   and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow
   the land.

   ^24And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the
   fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of
   the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for
   food for your little ones.

   ^25And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the
   sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

   ^26And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that
   Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests
   only, which became not Pharaoh's.

   ^27And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and
   they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

   ^28And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole
   age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

   ^29And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son
   Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put,
   I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with
   me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

   ^30But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
   Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as
   thou hast said.

   ^31And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed
   himself upon the bed's head.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 48

   And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
   thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and
   Ephraim.

   ^2And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
   thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

   ^3And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in
   the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

   ^4And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply
   thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this
   land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

   ^5And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee
   in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as
   Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

   ^6And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and
   shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

   ^7And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land
   of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto
   Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is
   Bethlehem.

   ^8And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

   ^9And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath
   given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me,
   and I will bless them.

   ^10Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.
   And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
   them.

   ^11And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and,
   lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

   ^12And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
   himself with his face to the earth.

   ^13And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's
   left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand,
   and brought them near unto him.

   ^14And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's
   head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head,
   guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

   ^15And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham
   and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this
   day,

   ^16The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let
   my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
   and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

   ^17And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
   head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,
   to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

   ^18And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the
   firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

   ^19And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he
   also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his
   younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a
   multitude of nations.

   ^20And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless,
   saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim
   before Manasseh.

   ^21And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with
   you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

   ^22Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which
   I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 49

   And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together,
   that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

   ^2Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken
   unto Israel your father.

   ^3Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
   strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

   ^4Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to
   thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.

   ^5Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their
   habitations.

   ^6O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine
   honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in
   their selfwill they digged down a wall.

   ^7Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was
   cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

   ^8Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be
   in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down
   before thee.

   ^9Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he
   stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse
   him up?

   ^10The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
   his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the
   people be.

   ^11Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice
   vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of
   grapes:

   ^12His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

   ^13Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an
   haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

   ^14Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

   ^15And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant;
   and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

   ^16Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

   ^17Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth
   the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

   ^18I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.

   ^19Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

   ^20Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
   dainties.

   ^21Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

   ^22Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose
   branches run over the wall:

   ^23The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:

   ^24But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made
   strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the
   shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

   ^25Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
   Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
   blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and
   of the womb:

   ^26The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my
   progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall
   be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was
   separate from his brethren.

   ^27Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the
   prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

   ^28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their
   father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his
   blessing he blessed them.

   ^29And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my
   people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of
   Ephron the Hittite,

   ^30In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
   Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of
   Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

   ^31There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
   Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

   ^32The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from
   the children of Heth.

   ^33And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered
   up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered
   unto his people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 50

   And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed
   him.

   ^2And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
   father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

   ^3And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days
   of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him
   threescore and ten days.

   ^4And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the
   house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
   speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

   ^5My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have
   digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now
   therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will
   come again.

   ^6And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made
   thee swear.

   ^7And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the
   servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the
   land of Egypt,

   ^8And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's
   house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they
   left in the land of Goshen.

   ^9And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a
   very great company.

   ^10And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan,
   and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he
   made a mourning for his father seven days.

   ^11And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
   mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning
   to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,
   which is beyond Jordan.

   ^12And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

   ^13For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
   the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field
   for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

   ^14And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that
   went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

   ^15And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they
   said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
   all the evil which we did unto him.

   ^16And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
   command before he died, saying,

   ^17So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass
   of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now,
   we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy
   father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

   ^18And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they
   said, Behold, we be thy servants.

   ^19And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?

   ^20But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto
   good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

   ^21Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.
   And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

   ^22And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph
   lived an hundred and ten years.

   ^23And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
   children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon
   Joseph's knees.

   ^24And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit
   you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to
   Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

   ^25And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will
   surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

   ^26So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
   embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

  The Second Book of Moses, Called

Exodus
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 1

   Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
   Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

   ^2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

   ^3Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

   ^4Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

   ^5And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
   souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

   ^6And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

   ^7And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
   and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled
   with them.

   ^8Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

   ^9And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
   Israel are more and mightier than we:

   ^10Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it
   come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto
   our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.

   ^11Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
   their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and
   Raamses.

   ^12But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
   And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

   ^13And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:

   ^14And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and
   in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service,
   wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

   ^15And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the
   name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

   ^16And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women,
   and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him:
   but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

   ^17But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
   commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

   ^18And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,
   Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?

   ^19And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not
   as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the
   midwives come in unto them.

   ^20Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
   multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

   ^21And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made
   them houses.

   ^22And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born
   ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
   of Levi.

   ^2And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he
   was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

   ^3And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
   bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child
   therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

   ^4And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

   ^5And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river;
   and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the
   ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

   ^6And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe
   wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the
   Hebrews' children.

   ^7Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to
   thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
   thee?

   ^8And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called
   the child's mother.

   ^9And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse
   it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the
   child, and nursed it.

   ^10And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and
   he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because
   I drew him out of the water.

   ^11And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
   went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied
   an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

   ^12And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was
   no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

   ^13And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
   strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore
   smitest thou thy fellow?

   ^14And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest
   thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and
   said, Surely this thing is known.

   ^15Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
   Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:
   and he sat down by a well.

   ^16Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew
   water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

   ^17And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and
   helped them, and watered their flock.

   ^18And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye
   are come so soon to day?

   ^19And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
   shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

   ^20And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye
   have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

   ^21And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
   Zipporah his daughter.

   ^22And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said,
   I have been a stranger in a strange land.

   ^23And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died:
   and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they
   cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

   ^24And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with
   Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

   ^25And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
   them.

    Chapter 3

   Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of
   Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to
   the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

   ^2And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of
   the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
   fire, and the bush was not consumed.

   ^3And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why
   the bush is not burnt.

   ^4And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
   him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,
   Here am I.

   ^5And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
   feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

   ^6Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
   God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was
   afraid to look upon God.

   ^7And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
   which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their
   taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

   ^8And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
   and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large,
   unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and
   the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

   ^9Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto
   me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress
   them.

   ^10Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
   mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

   ^11And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
   and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

   ^12And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a
   token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth
   the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

   ^13And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
   Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
   unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
   unto them?

   ^14And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt
   thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

   ^15And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
   children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is
   my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

   ^16Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The
   Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
   appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that
   which is done to you in Egypt:

   ^17And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt
   unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites,
   and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land
   flowing with milk and honey.

   ^18And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and
   the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto
   him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go,
   we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may
   sacrifice to the Lord our God.

   ^19And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by
   a mighty hand.

   ^20And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders
   which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you
   go.

   ^21And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
   and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:

   ^22But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
   sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
   raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters;
   and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

    Chapter 4

   And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor
   hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared
   unto thee.

   ^2And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said,
   A rod.

   ^3And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and
   it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

   ^4And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by
   the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod
   in his hand:

   ^5That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of
   Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
   thee.

   ^6And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
   bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out,
   behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

   ^7And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
   into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it
   was turned again as his other flesh.

   ^8And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
   hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the
   voice of the latter sign.

   ^9And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
   signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the
   water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which
   thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

   ^10And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
   heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow
   of speech, and of a slow tongue.

   ^11And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh
   the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord?

   ^12Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what
   thou shalt say.

   ^13And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom
   thou wilt send.

   ^14And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is
   not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And
   also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he
   will be glad in his heart.

   ^15And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
   will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
   shall do.

   ^16And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even
   he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
   instead of God.

   ^17And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do
   signs.

   ^18And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said
   unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are
   in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses,
   Go in peace.

   ^19And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for
   all the men are dead which sought thy life.

   ^20And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and
   he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his
   hand.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt,
   see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in
   thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the
   people go.

   ^22And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my
   son, even my firstborn:

   ^23And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if
   thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy
   firstborn.

   ^24And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him,
   and sought to kill him.

   ^25Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
   son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art
   thou to me.

   ^26So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because
   of the circumcision.

   ^27And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
   And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

   ^28And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and
   all the signs which he had commanded him.

   ^29And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the
   children of Israel:

   ^30And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses,
   and did the signs in the sight of the people.

   ^31And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had
   visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
   affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

    Chapter 5

   And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the
   Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto
   me in the wilderness.

   ^2And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to
   let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.

   ^3And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we
   pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the
   Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

   ^4And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
   Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

   ^5And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye
   make them rest from their burdens.

   ^6And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
   their officers, saying,

   ^7Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore:
   let them go and gather straw for themselves.

   ^8And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall
   lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle;
   therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

   ^9Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
   therein; and let them not regard vain words.

   ^10And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and
   they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give
   you straw.

   ^11Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
   work shall be diminished.

   ^12So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt
   to gather stubble instead of straw.

   ^13And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
   daily tasks, as when there was straw.

   ^14And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
   taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore
   have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
   day, as heretofore?

   ^15Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
   Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

   ^16There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make
   brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine
   own people.

   ^17But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go
   and do sacrifice to the Lord.

   ^18Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you,
   yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

   ^19And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in
   evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your
   bricks of your daily task.

   ^20And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
   forth from Pharaoh:

   ^21And they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because
   ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in
   the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

   ^22And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast
   thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

   ^23For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil
   to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

    Chapter 6

   Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
   Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong
   hand shall he drive them out of his land.

   ^2And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:

   ^3And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name
   of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

   ^4And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the
   land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were
   strangers.

   ^5And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
   the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

   ^6Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will
   bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid
   you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out
   arm, and with great judgments:

   ^7And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God:
   and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out
   from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

   ^8And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
   swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it
   you for an heritage: I am the Lord.

   ^9And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
   not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

   ^10And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^11Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of
   Israel go out of his land.

   ^12And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of
   Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who
   am of uncircumcised lips?

   ^13And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge
   unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
   the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

   ^14These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the
   firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the
   families of Reuben.

   ^15And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
   Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families
   of Simeon.

   ^16And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
   generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life
   of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

   ^17The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

   ^18And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:
   and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three
   years.

   ^19And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of
   Levi according to their generations.

   ^20And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she
   bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an
   hundred and thirty and seven years.

   ^21And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

   ^22And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

   ^23And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
   Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
   Ithamar.

   ^24And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are
   the families of the Korhites.

   ^25And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to
   wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of
   the Levites according to their families.

   ^26These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring out the
   children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

   ^27These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out
   the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

   ^28And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the
   land of Egypt,

   ^29That the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak thou
   unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

   ^30And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,
   and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh:
   and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

   ^2Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall
   speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his
   land.

   ^3And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my
   wonders in the land of Egypt.

   ^4But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
   Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
   Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

   ^5And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth
   mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among
   them.

   ^6And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, so did they.

   ^7And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
   years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

   ^8And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^9When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you:
   then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before
   Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

   ^10And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
   Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and
   before his servants, and it became a serpent.

   ^11Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
   magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
   enchantments.

   ^12For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but
   Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

   ^13And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as
   the Lord had said.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
   refuseth to let the people go.

   ^15Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
   water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and
   the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

   ^16And thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent
   me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the
   wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

   ^17Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord:
   behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
   which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

   ^18And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
   stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the
   river.

   ^19And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
   stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,
   upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of
   water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood
   throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in
   vessels of stone.

   ^20And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up
   the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of
   Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were
   in the river were turned to blood.

   ^21And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and
   the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was
   blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^22And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
   Lord had said.

   ^23And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his
   heart to this also.

   ^24And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
   drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

   ^25And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the
   river.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^2And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
   borders with frogs:

   ^3And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up
   and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed,
   and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine
   ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

   ^4And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
   upon all thy servants.

   ^5And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
   hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the
   ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

   ^6And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
   frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

   ^7And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
   frogs upon the land of Egypt.

   ^8Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the Lord,
   that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will
   let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord.

   ^9And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for
   thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs
   from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?

   ^10And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word:
   that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God.

   ^11And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from
   thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

   ^12And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the
   Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

   ^13And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died
   out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

   ^14And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

   ^15But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart,
   and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.

   ^16And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod,
   and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all
   the land of Egypt.

   ^17And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
   smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast;
   all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^18And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
   lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

   ^19Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the
   Lord had said.

   ^20And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto
   him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^21Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
   of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and
   into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of
   swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

   ^22And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people
   dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest
   know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.

   ^23And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
   morrow shall this sign be.

   ^24And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into
   the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the
   land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

   ^25And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
   sacrifice to your God in the land.

   ^26And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the
   abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: lo, shall we
   sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will
   they not stone us?

   ^27We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to
   the Lord our God, as he shall command us.

   ^28And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
   Lord your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:
   intreat for me.

   ^29And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the
   Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his
   servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal
   deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
   Lord.

   ^30And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord.

   ^31And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the
   swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people;
   there remained not one.

   ^32And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he
   let the people go.

    Chapter 9

   Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus
   saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may
   serve me.

   ^2For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

   ^3Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the
   field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen,
   and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.

   ^4And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle
   of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of
   Israel.

   ^5And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall
   do this thing in the land.

   ^6And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of
   Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

   ^7And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the
   Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not
   let the people go.

   ^8And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
   ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in
   the sight of Pharaoh.

   ^9And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be
   a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout
   all the land of Egypt.

   ^10And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
   Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking
   forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

   ^11And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils;
   for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

   ^12And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
   unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.

   ^13And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the
   Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^14For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
   upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
   there is none like me in all the earth.

   ^15For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
   people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

   ^16And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew
   in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the
   earth.

   ^17As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not
   let them go?

   ^18Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
   grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation
   thereof even until now.

   ^19Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in
   the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
   field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
   them, and they shall die.

   ^20He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh
   made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

   ^21And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and
   his cattle in the field.

   ^22And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
   heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and
   upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of
   Egypt.

   ^23And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent
   thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord
   rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

   ^24So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
   such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became
   a nation.

   ^25And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in
   the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
   field, and brake every tree of the field.

   ^26Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was
   there no hail.

   ^27And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
   them, I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my
   people are wicked.

   ^28Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
   thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no
   longer.

   ^29And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
   will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease,
   neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that
   the earth is the Lord'S.

   ^30But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear
   the Lord God.

   ^31And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the
   ear, and the flax was bolled.

   ^32But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown
   up.

   ^33And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his
   hands unto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was
   not poured upon the earth.

   ^34And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
   were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his
   servants.

   ^35And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
   children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened
   his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my
   signs before him:

   ^2And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's
   son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have
   done among them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord.

   ^3And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble
   thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^4Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I
   bring the locusts into thy coast:

   ^5And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able
   to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is
   escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every
   tree which groweth for you out of the field:

   ^6And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants,
   and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy
   fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth
   unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

   ^7And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a
   snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God:
   knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

   ^8And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto
   them, Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?

   ^9And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our
   sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we
   go; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord.

   ^10And he said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let
   you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

   ^11Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord; for that ye did
   desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

   ^12And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land
   of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt,
   and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

   ^13And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the
   Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that
   night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

   ^14And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in
   all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there
   were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

   ^15For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was
   darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of
   the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green
   thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^16Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
   have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.

   ^17Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
   intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death
   only.

   ^18And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord.

   ^19And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the
   locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust
   in all the coasts of Egypt.

   ^20But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
   children of Israel go.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
   that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which
   may be felt.

   ^22And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a
   thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

   ^23They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three
   days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

   ^24And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only
   let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go
   with you.

   ^25And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
   offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.

   ^26Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left
   behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know
   not with what we must serve the Lord, until we come thither.

   ^27But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

   ^28And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself,
   see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

   ^29And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no
   more.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 11

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon
   Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he
   shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

   ^2Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his
   neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and
   jewels of gold.

   ^3And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians.
   Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
   sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

   ^4And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out
   into the midst of Egypt:

   ^5And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
   firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the
   firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the
   firstborn of beasts.

   ^6And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such
   as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

   ^7But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
   tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth
   put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

   ^8And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
   themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that
   follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh
   in a great anger.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
   that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

   ^10And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the
   Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of
   Israel go out of his land.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 12

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

   ^2This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the
   first month of the year to you.

   ^3Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
   day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according
   to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:

   ^4And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
   neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the
   souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the
   lamb.

   ^5Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
   shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

   ^6And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month:
   and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in
   the evening.

   ^7And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts
   and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

   ^8And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
   unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

   ^9Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire;
   his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

   ^10And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that
   which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

   ^11And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your
   feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is
   the Lord'S passover.

   ^12For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite
   all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against
   all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord.

   ^13And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
   are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
   shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

   ^14And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it
   a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a
   feast by an ordinance for ever.

   ^15Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
   shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened
   bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut
   off from Israel.

   ^16And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the
   seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
   work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that
   only may be done of you.

   ^17And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
   selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
   therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance
   for ever.

   ^18In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye
   shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
   month at even.

   ^19Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
   whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut
   off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born
   in the land.

   ^20Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat
   unleavened bread.

   ^21Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them,
   Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the
   passover.

   ^22And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is
   in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the
   blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of
   his house until the morning.

   ^23For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he
   seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord
   will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in
   unto your houses to smite you.

   ^24And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy
   sons for ever.

   ^25And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
   Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep
   this service.

   ^26And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
   What mean ye by this service?

   ^27That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord'S passover, who
   passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he
   smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the
   head and worshipped.

   ^28And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had
   commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

   ^29And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the
   firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat
   on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the
   dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

   ^30And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all
   the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a
   house where there was not one dead.

   ^31And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and
   get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel;
   and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said.

   ^32Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone;
   and bless me also.

   ^33And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send
   them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

   ^34And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
   kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

   ^35And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and
   they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
   and raiment:

   ^36And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
   so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they
   spoiled the Egyptians.

   ^37And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about
   six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.

   ^38And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,
   even very much cattle.

   ^39And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
   forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust
   out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for
   themselves any victual.

   ^40Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
   was four hundred and thirty years.

   ^41And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
   even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord
   went out from the land of Egypt.

   ^42It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them
   out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be
   observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

   ^43And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the
   passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

   ^44But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast
   circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

   ^45A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

   ^46In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of
   the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone
   thereof.

   ^47All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

   ^48And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
   passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let
   him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the
   land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

   ^49One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that
   sojourneth among you.

   ^50Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and
   Aaron, so did they.

   ^51And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the
   children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 13

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among
   the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

   ^3And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came
   out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand
   the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread
   be eaten.

   ^4This day came ye out in the month Abib.

   ^5And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and
   the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land
   flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this
   month.

   ^6Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day
   shall be a feast to the Lord.

   ^7Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
   leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen
   with thee in all thy quarters.

   ^8And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because
   of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

   ^9And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
   memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord'S law may be in thy mouth:
   for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.

   ^10Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to
   year.

   ^11And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the
   Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it
   thee,

   ^12That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix,
   and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males
   shall be the Lord'S.

   ^13And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if
   thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the
   firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

   ^14And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
   What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the
   Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

   ^15And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the
   Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of
   man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all
   that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my
   children I redeem.

   ^16And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
   between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth
   out of Egypt.

   ^17And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God
   led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although
   that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when
   they see war, and they return to Egypt:

   ^18But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of
   the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the
   land of Egypt.

   ^19And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
   sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye
   shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

   ^20And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in
   the edge of the wilderness.

   ^21And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead
   them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to
   go by day and night:

   ^22He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
   fire by night, from before the people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 14

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before
   Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before
   it shall ye encamp by the sea.

   ^3For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in
   the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

   ^4And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them;
   and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the
   Egyptians may know that I am the Lord. And they did so.

   ^5And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart
   of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they
   said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving
   us?

   ^6And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

   ^7And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of
   Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

   ^8And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
   pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went
   out with an high hand.

   ^9But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of
   Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by
   the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

   ^10And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their
   eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore
   afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.

   ^11And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
   hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
   dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

   ^12Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us
   alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us
   to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

   ^13And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see
   the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day: for the
   Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for
   ever.

   ^14The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

   ^15And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
   unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

   ^16But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground
   through the midst of the sea.

   ^17And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they
   shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all
   his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   ^18And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten
   me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   ^19And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed
   and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before
   their face, and stood behind them:

   ^20And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
   Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by
   night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

   ^21And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused
   the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the
   sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

   ^22And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the
   dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand,
   and on their left.

   ^23And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of
   the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

   ^24And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto
   the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud,
   and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

   ^25And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so
   that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the
   Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

   ^26And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
   and upon their horsemen.

   ^27And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
   returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians
   fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
   the sea.

   ^28And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen,
   and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there
   remained not so much as one of them.

   ^29But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the
   sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on
   their left.

   ^30Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
   Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

   ^31And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the
   Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and
   his servant Moses.

    Chapter 15

   Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and
   spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

   ^2The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he
   is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I
   will exalt him.

   ^3The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.

   ^4Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen
   captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

   ^5The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

   ^6Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand,
   O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

   ^7And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them
   that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed
   them as stubble.

   ^8And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,
   the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in
   the heart of the sea.

   ^9The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
   spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my
   hand shall destroy them.

   ^10Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as
   lead in the mighty waters.

   ^11Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

   ^12Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

   ^13Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
   redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
   habitation.

   ^14The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
   inhabitants of Palestina.

   ^15Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
   trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
   shall melt away.

   ^16Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm
   they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord,
   till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

   ^17Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine
   inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to
   dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

   ^18The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

   ^19For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
   horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea
   upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
   the sea.

   ^20And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in
   her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
   dances.

   ^21And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

   ^22So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the
   wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and
   found no water.

   ^23And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of
   Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

   ^24And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

   ^25And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord shewed him a tree, which
   when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he
   made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

   ^26And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord
   thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give
   ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of
   these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for
   I am the Lord that healeth thee.

   ^27And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
   threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

    Chapter 16

   And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the
   children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between
   Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their
   departing out of the land of Egypt.

   ^2And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against
   Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

   ^3And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died
   by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh
   pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us
   forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

   ^4Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
   for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every
   day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.

   ^5And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
   that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather
   daily.

   ^6And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even,
   then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of
   Egypt:

   ^7And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord; for that
   he heareth your murmurings against the Lord: and what are we, that ye
   murmur against us?

   ^8And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the
   evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that
   the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what
   are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.

   ^9And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
   children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your
   murmurings.

   ^10And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of
   the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and,
   behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.

   ^11And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^12I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto
   them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall
   be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.

   ^13And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered
   the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

   ^14And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
   wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on
   the ground.

   ^15And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It
   is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This
   is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.

   ^16This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every
   man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the
   number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his
   tents.

   ^17And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
   less.

   ^18And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had
   nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered
   every man according to his eating.

   ^19And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

   ^20Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left
   of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was
   wroth with them.

   ^21And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
   eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

   ^22And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as
   much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the
   congregation came and told Moses.

   ^23And
